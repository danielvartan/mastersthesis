## Overview

This repository contains the research compendium and [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) of my master's thesis: _Ecology of sleep and circadian phenotypes of the Brazilian population_. Its aim is to facilitate research work and to improve reproducibility.

Click [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/mastersthesis/) to access the thesis documents.

The assemble of this repository was inspired by Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger & Lincoln Mullen's article [Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986).

## How to use

The analyses contained in this thesis are 100% reproducible. They were made using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and the  [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system. The [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package was used to ensure that the R environment used can be restored (see `renv.lock`). The computational notebooks can be found in the `qmd` directory.

It's important to note that some restrictions apply to the availability of the  main research data, which were used under the approval of a Research Ethics Committee (REC) linked to the [Brazilian National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP)](https://conselho.saude.gov.br/Web_comissoes/conep/index.html). As a result, this data cannot be publicly shared. To run the analyses, users must have an internet connection and request a set of access keys from the author.

To reproduce the analyses do the following steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the R project (`mastersthesis.Rproj`).
3. Run [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv//reference/restore.html) to install all software dependencies.
4. Open and run the analysis in the computational notebook.

If you don't feel comfortable with R, I strongly recommend checking Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's free and online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the Coursera course from John Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) (free for audit students).

However, it can be provided by the author upon reasonable request. If the intention is to use the data for new research, the request will need approval from CONEP, which must be made with the author's approval and participation.
