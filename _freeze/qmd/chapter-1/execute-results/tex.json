This chapter is currently a dumping ground for ideas, and I don't recommend reading it.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\\vspace{10pt}\n:::\n\n## On chronobiology\n\n## On complex systems\n\n## On the entrainment phenomenon\n\n## Aims\n\n## Projects developed\n\n## Other related activities\n\n### Classes\n\nWhile this thesis was developed, the following Graduate classes from the University of São Paulo (USP) were completed.\n\n* 2022/2: _SCX5000 - Mathematical and Computational Methods I_ (10 credits) (Concept: __C__);\n* 2022/2: _SCX5002 - Complex Systems I_ (10 credits) (Concept: __A__);\n* 2023/1: _SCX5001 - Mathematical and Computational Methods II_ (10 credits) (Concept: __A__);\n* 2023/1: _SCX5017 - Introduction to Data Science_ (10 credits) (Concept: __A__);\n* 2023/1: _EAH5001 - Pedagogic Preparation_ (4 credits) (Concept: __A__).\n\nPlease note that the unfortunate __C__ concept above happened in the same semester when the author broke relations with his former supervisor (_Mario Pedrazzoli_).\n\nIn total, 44 credits were completed until the thesis publication date. Another 12 special credits related to an article publication (see @viana-mendes2023) were requested, according to [program regulations](https://leginf.usp.br/?resolucao=resolucao-copgr-no-7829-de-03-de-outubro-de-2019), to the Graduate Program Coordination Commission (CCP) and should be evaluated by the end of October 2023. A minimum of 50 credits is needed for the thesis defense.\n\n### Teaching internship\n\nScholarship students of the [Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)](https://www.gov.br/capes/) must participate in the [Teaching Improvement Program (PAE)](www5.each.usp.br/pae/). This internship is ongoing and will end in December 2023.\n\nThe internship activities comprise being an Assistant Professor for USP's undergraduate class _ACH0042 - Problem-Based Learning II_. A teaching plan was written while taking the _EAH5001_ graduate class mentioned above and can be accessed at the link below.\n\n<!-- @vartanian2023e -->\n\nVartanian, D., Bernardes, M. E.
