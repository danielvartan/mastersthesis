## Hypothesis test {.smaller}

The main idea of nested models is to verify the effect of the inclusion of one or more predictors in the model variance explanation (i.e., the $\text{R}^{2}$) [@allen1997]. This can be made by creating a restricted model and then comparing it with a full model. Hence, the hypothesis can be schematized as follows.

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
$$
\begin{cases}
\text{H}_{0}: \text{R}^{2}_{r} >= \text{R}^{2}_{f} \\
\text{H}_{a}: \text{R}^{2}_{r} < \text{R}^{2}_{f}
\end{cases}
$$
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
$$
f^{2} = \cfrac{\text{R}^{2}_{f} - \text{R}^{2}_{r}}{1 - \text{R}^{2}_{f}} = \cfrac{\text{Additional Var. Explained}}{\text{Var. unexplained}}
$$

## Population {.smaller}

According to the Continuous National Household Sample Survey ([PNAD](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/trabalho/9171-pesquisa-nacional-por-amostra-de-domicilios-continua-mensal.html)), in 2017, Brazil had an illiteracy rate of $6.9\%$ among individuals aged 18 years or older [@ibgef].

In that same year, the Brazilian population in this age group comprised approximately $151,321,000$ individuals [@ibgeg]. Considering these two pieces of data, it can be inferred that there were around $140,879,851$ literate individuals aged 18 years or older in Brazil in 2017.

According to the PNAD, the proportion of men and women above 18 years old in 2017 was $48.163\%$ and $51.837\%$, respectively [@ibgee]. Another edition of the same study showed that internet usage covered $82.17\%$ of Brazilian households in 2019 [@ibge2021]. Based on this data, it is estimated that the size of the population to be represented in this study is around $115,760,973$ individuals, which corresponds to approximately $76.500\%$ of the adult Brazilian population in 2017.

## Sample (raw) chracteristics {.smaller}

* Convenience sample (non-probabilistic)
* Unit of observation and analysis: Individuals
* Total of $120,265$ entries in the raw state
* $118,068$ responses within a seven-day window (from 15th to 21st October 2017)
* Encompasses all states of Brazil
* $92,107$ Brazilian resident subjects aged 18 years or older ($78.012\%$ of the total) (ages between $18-79$ years; mean of $32.726 \pm 10.176$ years)
* $66.320\%$ are female (ages between $18-79$ years; mean of $32.543 \pm 10.259$ years) and $33.600\%$ are male (ages between $18-79$ years; mean of $33.076 \pm 9.987$ years)
* It is assumed that individuals in the sample are literate and have internet access, as it would not be possible to respond to the questionnaire without these characteristics.
