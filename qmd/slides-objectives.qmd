## Object and objectives {.smaller}

This thesis focuses on the _ecology of sleep and circadian phenotypes (chronotypes)_ with the aim of providing answers to the following __questions__:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
__Q1__. How are the sleep-wake cycles and circadian phenotypes of the adult Brazilian population characterized?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
__Q2__. Is latitude associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms in humans?
:::
::::

The primary objectives (PO) are as follows:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
__PO1__. Quantitatively describe the expression of sleep-wake cycles and circadian phenotypes of the Brazilian adult population at the end of the year 2017 (pre-pandemic).

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
__PO2__. Investigate and model the presence/absence of a significant association and effect between decimal degrees of latitude (independent variable (IV)) and circadian phenotypes (dependent variable (DV)) of the Brazilian population.

## Methods and hypothesis {.smaller}

* Problem approach method: Hypothetico-deductive method [@popper1979]
* Procedure method: Statistical methods

The basic hypothesis to be tested is that populations residing near the equator (latitude 0Â°) have, on average, a shorter/more morning-oriented circadian phenotype compared to populations living near the Earth's poles [@hut2013; @leocadio-miguel2014; @leocadio-miguel2017; @pittendrigh1991; @randler2008; @randler2017; @roenneberg2003].
