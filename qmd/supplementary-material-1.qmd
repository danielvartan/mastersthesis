## Overview

This document provides a detailed outline of the thesis's research question, objective, and hypothesis.

## Research Question

Every scientific inquiry should be guided by a central question. For this study, the guiding question is:

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold; color: #ea7701; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;"}
Is latitude associated with chronotype?
:::

## Objective

The primary objective is to model and test the hypothesis underlying this question within the context of human circadian rhythms, by critically assessing whether there is a meaningful association  between latitude and circadian phenotypes in the Brazilian population.

## Hypothesis

To address the research question, the study employs Popper’s hypothetico-deductive method. This approach is structured as follows:

> Here $\text{P}_1$, is the **problem** from which we start, $\text{TT}$ (the ‘tentative theory’) is the imaginative conjectural solution which we first reach, for example our first **tentative interpretation**. $\text{EE}$ (‘**error- elimination**’) consists of a severe critical examination of our conjecture, our tentative interpretation: it consists, for example, of the critical use of documentary evidence and, if we have at this early stage more than one conjecture at our disposal, it will also consist of a critical discussion and comparative evaluation of the competing conjectures. $\text{P}_2$ is the problem situation as it emerges from our first critical attempt to solve our problems. It leads up to our second attempt (**and so on**) [@popper1979, p. 164].

The central hypothesis of this study, as outlined in Chapter 1, is:

__Hypothesis__
: *Latitude is associated with chronotype distributions*, with populations closer to the equator exhibiting, on average, a shorter or more morning-oriented circadian phenotype compared to those residing near the poles.

This hypothesis is grounded in early discussions in chronobiology and is supported by numerous studies, including: @hut2013; @leocadio-miguel2014; @leocadio-miguel2017; @pittendrigh1991; @randler2008; @randler2017; @roenneberg2003.

To evaluate the hypothesis, the study adopts an improved approach to Null Hypothesis Significance Testing ([NHST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test)), rooted in the original Neyman-Pearson framework for data testing [@neyman1928; @neyman1928a; @perezgonzalez2015]. The hypotheses are formally stated as follows:

$$
\begin{cases}
\text{H}_{0}: \text{Latitude is not associated with chronotype} \\
\text{H}_{a}: \text{Latitude is associated with chronotype}
\end{cases}
$$
