The first mention of this hypothesis in English scientific literature dates back to at least 1973, as noted by @bohlen1973, with earlier hints of the idea from Erhard Haus and Franz Halberg in 1970 [@haus1970, p. 101], building on discussions initiated by Jürgen Aschoff [@aschoff1969]. Since then, numerous studies have explored this topic, yielding somewhat conflicting results (a systematic review is provided by @randler2017).

The hypothesis, also called *environment hypothesis*, posits that regions closer to the poles receive, on average, less annual sunlight compared to regions near the equator (@fig-chapter-4-hut-2013-figure-1). Consequently, regions around latitude 0° are thought to have a stronger solar zeitgeber. According to chronobiological theories, this stronger zeitgeber would enhance the synchronization of circadian rhythms with the light-dark cycle, resulting in lower variability and amplitude of circadian phenotypes. This reduced influence of individual endogenous periods is illustrated in @fig-chapter-4-roenneberg-2003-figure-7-f-adapted.

In contrast, populations near the poles experience a weaker solar zeitgeber, leading to greater variability and amplitude of circadian phenotypes. This disparity translates into differences in chronotype: equatorial populations tend to exhibit a morningness orientation, while populations at higher and low latitudes tend toward eveningness [@bohlen1973; @roenneberg2003].

Some authors claim to found this association, but a closer look at the data reveals that it is not as clear as it seems. For example, @leocadio-miguel2017 found a significant association between latitude and chronotype in a sample of $12,884$ Brazilian participants. However, the effect size was negligible, with latitude explaining only about $0.388\%$ of the variance in chronotype (@fig-chapter-4-leocadio-miguel-2017-figure-2). Considering the particular emphasis that the solar zeitgeber has on the entrainment of biological rhythms (as demonstrated in many experiments), it would not be reasonable to assume that the latitude hypothesis could be supported without at least a non-negligible effect size.

The findings of @leocadio-miguel2017 are not consistent with the hypothesis that latitude is a strong predictor of chronotype, as the reported effect size is too small to be considered practically significant [@cohen1988]. This highlights a common limitation of studies relying on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) [@perezgonzalez2015]. A p-value does not measure the effect size; instead, it represents the probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) assuming the null hypothesis is true, thus quantifying the likelihood of a type I error [@cohen1994; @wasserstein2016].

Mean scores (±SE) on the Horne & Östberg (HO) chronotype scale [@horne1976] are presented across a latitudinal gradient, along with the corresponding annual average solar irradiation levels (W/m²). The HO scale comprises 19 items, with total scores ranging from 16 to 86; lower scores indicate a stronger evening orientation, while higher scores reflect a greater morning orientation. Notably, the y-axis exaggerates the visual impact of the differences, as it represents a range of only about 4.5 points, which may overstate the perceived significance of the effect.

Several factors may invalidate this hypothesis, such as local clock time and social constraints [@skeldon2021]. To gain a more accurate understanding of the mechanisms underlying chronotype expression, it remains crucial to test this hypothesis in larger samples. This study aims to address that gap.

In the following sections, the hypothesis will be tested using one of the largest chronotype datasets, to the author's knowledge, with geocoding information integrated for a comprehensive analysis. The approach will adhere to sound statistical principles, incorporating a minimum effect size in the alternative hypothesis, as originally proposed by Neyman and Pearson data testing framework [@neyman1928; @neyman1928a].

<!-- "[...] however social factors (including the effect of putting on the electric light when the alarm clock rings) might counteract this. [@bohlen1973, p. 91] -->

<!-- "This last fact contradicts the otherwise plausible interpretation of our data that strength of Zeitgeber (and hence precision) is greatest when the light/dark ratio is 1:1. The strength of the Zeitgeber certainly depends on the light/dark ratio [5] and it may be expected to influence precision, too. However, unexplained additional factors must complicate the picture. It is unknown whether the fluctuations in precision have an ecological significance." [@aschoff1972] -->

<!-- "Latitude and longitude are key factors that influence how light–dark cycle interacts with the circadian rhythm of humans. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that chronotype distribution of a population may vary as a result of different geographical location." [@leocadio-miguel2014] -->

<!-- "However, it is also our experience that some mathematically sophisticated scientists may lack the conceptual frame that links the mathematical procedures to the substantive scientific task in a particular case" [@cohen2002]. -->

<!-- Effect sizes. Statistical ritual versus statistical thinking [@gigerenzer2004]. -->

<!-- A p-value is not evidence of the existence of an effect., it's only indirect evidence at best. Large samples and the p-value problem [@lin2013]. P-values as an exponential model of data sizes [@mariscal2021]. A small p-value does not imply that there is an important effect; it only tells us something about the plausibility of the effect. You need to have a meaningful effect to have an interesting result, and the p-value doesn't tell you that. -->

<!-- The original article had two issues regarding data testing, commonly related to null hypothesis significance tests (NHST). It is not within the scope of this article to discuss all the issues regarding NHST; for that, I recommend checking @perezgonzalez2015. The two main methodological issues regarding the hypothesis test in the original article were:  -->

<!-- 1. Using the p-value instead of the effect size as a criterion for rejecting or accepting the alternative hypothesis; -->
<!-- 2. Failing to integrate a minimum effect size in the alternative hypothesis. A test without the latter can create serious distortions in the interpretation of the results, since even a negligible effect could lead to the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis. -->
