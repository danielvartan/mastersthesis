During the development of this thesis, several activities have been accomplished. These activities are important to note, as they demonstrate the path taken to arrive at this final document. The following sections detail the some of them.

## Courses

The following graduate courses from the University of São Paulo ([USP](https://www5.usp.br/)) were completed during the first year of the master's program.

* 2022/2: [_SCX5000 - Mathematical and Computational Methods I_](https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=SCX5000) (10 credits) (Concept: __C__);
* 2022/2: [_SCX5002 - Complex Systems I_](https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=SCX5002) (10 credits) (Concept: __A__);
* 2023/1: [_SCX5001 - Mathematical and Computational Methods II_](https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=SCX5001) (10 credits) (Concept: __A__);
* 2023/1: [_SCX5017 - Introduction to Data Science_](https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=SCX5017) (10 credits) (Concept: __A__);
* 2023/1: [_EAH5001 - Pedagogic Preparation_](https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=EAH5001) (4 credits) (Concept: __A__).

Please note that the unfortunate __C__ concept above happened in the same semester when the author broke relations with his former supervisor.

44 discipline credits were completed by this thesis publication date. An additional 12 special credits, related to an article publication (see @viana-mendes2023), were requested and approved by the Graduate Program Coordination Commission (CCP) in accordance with [program regulations](https://leginf.usp.br/?resolucao=resolucao-copgr-no-7829-de-03-de-outubro-de-2019). In total, 56 credits were earned. A minimum of 50 credits is required for the thesis defense.

## Teaching internship

Scholarship students under the [Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)](https://www.gov.br/capes/) are required to participate in the [Teaching Improvement Program (PAE)](www5.each.usp.br/pae/). This internship occur in the 2º semester of 2023.

The internship responsibilities entailed serving as an Assistant Professor for the undergraduate course [_ACH0042 - Problem-Based Learning II_](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?nomdis=&sgldis=ACH0042) at USP. A comprehensive teaching plan was formulated during enrollment in the aforementioned graduate course _EAH5001_, and it is accessible through the following link.

## Publications

The following article was published during the development of this thesis.

<!-- @viana-mendes2023 -->

## Translations

As a member and package developer of the [rOpenSci Initiative](https://ropensci.org/), the author is actively contributing to the [ongoing translation](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide/pull/717) of the [rOpenSci Developer Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) into Portuguese. The aim is to create a more inclusive environment for individuals in Brazil and other Portuguese-speaking countries when developing for the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).

This endeavor is linked to the thesis, as the author's membership in rOpenSci began with the creation of the [{mctq} R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/mctq/) (listed below).

## Conferences

An abstract pertaining to the primary investigation was published and presented on a poster at the [Sao Paulo School of Advanced Science on Ecology of Human Sleep and Biological Rhythms](https://espca.fapesp.br/school/sao_paulo_school_of_advanced_science_on_ecology_of_human_sleep_and_biological_rhythms/101/) organized by the [São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)](https://fapesp.br/en). This international school hosted 100 participants, including students and young researchers, with a diverse representation of 50 individuals from various states within Brazil and an additional 50 from international backgrounds. The event took place from November 16, 2022, to November 26, 2022.

In the same semester (2022/2), the author also participated in USP's International Symposium on Scientific and Technological Initiation ([SIICUSP](https://prpi.usp.br/siicusp/)) as both an examiner and a participant. As a participant, the author presented a research abstract related to the [{actverse} R package](https://github.com/giperbio/actverse) for actigraphy data analysis, as detailed in @matias2022 and @vartaniang. This project was conceived and developed by the author of this thesis and involved collaboration with two undergraduate students. Notably, this project achieved recognition, securing 2nd place in the category of _Earth and Exact Sciences_.
