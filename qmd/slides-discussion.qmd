A significant p-value ($\text{p-value} = 2e-16$) was found, but with a negligible effect size (Cohenâ€™s $f^2 = 0.00740$). Based on these results, we must reject $\text{H}_{a}$ in favor of $\text{H}_{0}$.

$$
\begin{cases}
\text{H}_{0}: \text{R}^{2}_{r} >= \text{R}^{2}_{f} \\
\text{H}_{a}: \text{R}^{2}_{r} < \text{R}^{2}_{f}
\end{cases}
$$

It is then possible to answer one of the study main question: _Is latitude associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms in humans?_ Based on these results the answer is __no__.

Despite the lack of evidence, is not uncommon to hear talks insisting that the latitude effect is real and already confirmed, but, at this time, at least in humans, no empirical evidence can support this claim.

The results show that even with a wide latitudinal spectrum and with a big and aligned sample of biological states the latitude effect does not reveal itself in a non-negligible size.

As Karl Popper said, science begins and ends with questions [@popper1979]. The absence of a strong entrainment with the solar zeitgeber shows that the entrainment phenomenon is more complex than we previously imagined. Other hypotheses for the human circadian entrainment, like the entrainment to self-selected light, proposed by Anna Skeldon and Derk-Jan Dijk [-@skeldon2021], need to be tested and may produce significant results.
