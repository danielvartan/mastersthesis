# Methods

## The Hypotesis Test {.smaller}

The study tested whether *latitude* significantly improves model fit when predicting chronotype with nested models. A restricted model (excluding latitude) with a full model (including latitude) was compared. To ensure practical significance, a Minimum Effect Size (MES) criterion was applied, following the original Neyman-Pearson framework for hypothesis testing [@neyman1928; @neyman1928a; @perezgonzalez2015].

The MES was set at Cohen's threshold for small effects ($f^2 = 0.02$, equivalent to $\text{R}^2 = 0.01960784$) [@cohen1988a, p. 413]. Thus, latitude was considered significant only if its inclusion accounted for at least $1.960784\%$ of the variance in the dependent variable.

## The Hypotesis Test {.smaller}

The hypothesis can be outlined as follows:

Null hypothesis ($\text{H}_{0}$)
: Adding *latitude* does not meaningfully improve the model’s fit. This implies that the change in adjusted $\text{R}^{2}$ is negligible, or the F-test is not significant, given a type I error probability ($\alpha$) of $0.05$.

Alternative Hypothesis ($\text{H}_{a}$)
: Adding *latitude* meaningfully improves the model’s fit. This implies that the change in adjusted $\text{R}^{2}$ exceeds the expected Minimum Effect Size (MES), and the F-test is significant, given a type I error probability ($\alpha$) of $0.05$.

::: {.center-x}
$$
\begin{cases}
\text{H}_{0}: \Delta \ \text{Adjusted} \ \text{R}^{2} \leq \text{MES} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{F-test is not significant} \ (\alpha \geq 0.05) \\
\text{H}_{a}: \Delta \ \text{Adjusted} \ \text{R}^{2} > \text{MES} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{F-test is significant} \ (\alpha < 0.05)
\end{cases}

## The *p*-value Problem

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column style="width: 50%; padding-top: 0px;"}
Big samples and sensibility: Is a difference of $0.000000001$ valid?

> SMALL EFFECT SIZE: $f^2 = .02$. Translated into $\text{R}^{2}$ or partial $\text{R}^{2}$ for Case 1, this gives $.02 / (1 + .02) = .0196$. We thus define a small effect as one that accounts for 2% of the $\text{Y}$ variance (in contrast with 1% for $r$), and translate to an $\text{R} = \sqrt{0196} = .14$ (compared to .10 for $r$). This is a modest enough amount, **just barely escaping triviality** and (alas!) all too frequently in practice represents the true order of magnitude of the effect being tested [@cohen1988a, p. 413].

> [...] in many circumstances, all that is intended by "proving" the null hypothesis is that the ES [Effect Size] is not necessarily zero but **small enough to be negligible** [...]. [@cohen1988a, p. 461].

Comparison of a 95% of confidence level ($\alpha = 0.05$) and an *n*-dependent *p-value* curve. The parameter $n_{\alpha}$ represents the minimum sample size to detect statistically significant differences among compared groups. The parameter $n_{\gamma}$ represents the convergence point of the *p-value* curve. When the *p-value* curve expresses practical differences, the area under the red curve ($A_{p(n)}$) is smaller than the area under the constant function $\alpha = 0.05$ ($A_{\alpha = 0.05}$) when it is evaluated between $0$ and $n_{\gamma}$.

# Conclusion

## Answer

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column style="width: 50%; padding-top: 0px;"}

> I suggest that **it is the aim of science to find satisfactory explanations**, of whatever strikes us as being in need of explanation [@popper1979, p. 193].

Using what is arguably the largest dataset on chronotype collected within a single time zone, balanced to reflect population proportions at the time of data collection, found no support for the latitude hypothesis. This result contributes meaningful evidence to the understanding of circadian rhythm regulation, offering a clear and satisfactory answer to the central research question of this thesis regarding human populations: Is latitude associated with chronotype? The answer, at present, is [**No**]{.brandorange}.

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

The activity can be represented by a **general schema of problem- solving by the method of imaginative conjectures and criticism**, or, as I have often called it, by **the method of conjecture and refutation**. The schema (in its simplest form) is this:

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

Here $\text{P}_1$, is the **problem** from which we start, $\text{TT}$ (the ‘tentative theory’) is the imaginative conjectural solution which we first reach, for example our first **tentative interpretation**. $\text{EE}$ (‘**error- elimination**’) consists of a severe critical examination of our conjecture, our tentative interpretation: it consists, for example, of the critical use of documentary evidence and, if we have at this early stage more than one conjecture at our disposal, it will also consist of a critical discussion and comparative evaluation of the competing conjectures. $\text{P}_2$ is the problem situation as it emerges from our first critical attempt to solve our problems.
It leads up to our second attempt (**and so on**).

## (AP) Popper's hypothetico-deductive method {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

The history of ideas teaches us very clearly that ideas emerge in logical or, if the term is preferred, in **dialectical contexts**. My various schemata such as

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 6.5

flowchart LR
  A(P1) --> B(TT)
  B --> C(EE)
  C --> D(P2)
```

may indeed be looked upon as improvements and rationalizations of the Hegelian dialectical schema: they are rationalizations because they operate entirely within the classical logical organon of rational criticism, which is based upon the so-called law of contradiction; that is to say, upon the demand that contradictions, whenever we discover them, must be eliminated. Critical error-elimination on the scientific level proceeds by way of a **conscious search for contradictions**.

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

*Notre activité intellectuelle est suffisamment excitée par le pur espoir de découvrir les lois des phénomènes, par le simple **désir de confirmer** ou d'infirmer une théorie. [...] la philosophie positive est le véritable **état définitif** de l'intelligence humaine [...]* [@comte1892, pp. 9-10].

**Why post-positivist?**

- Anti-inductivist (deduction, satisfactory answers)
- Anti-verificationist (falsifiability as demarcation criterion)
- Anti-historicist (rebuttable presumptions)

## (AP) Popper against positivism (or the problem of induction) {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

But I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience. These considerations suggest that **not the _verifiability_ but the _falsifiability_ of a system is to be taken as a criterion of demarcation**. In other words: I shall not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: **it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience**.

Everybody knows nowadays that **logical positivism is dead**. But nobody seems to suspect that there may be a question to be asked here — the question “Who is responsible?” or, rather, the question “Who has done it?”. (Passmore’s excellent historical article does not raise this question.) **I fear that I must admit responsibility**.

(@) It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory —if we look for confirmations.
(@) Confirmations should count only if they are the result of *risky predictions*; that is to say, if, unenlightened by the theory in question, we should have expected an event which was incompatible with the theory—an event which would have refuted the theory.

:::: {.columns}

(@) Every ‘good’ scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen. The more a theory forbids, the better it is.
(@) A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is nonscientific.
Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column style="width: 50%; padding-top: 0px;"}
(@) Every genuine *test* of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it.
Testability is falsifiability; but there are degrees of testability: some theories are more testable, more exposed to refutation, than others; they take, as it were, greater risks.
(@) Confirming evidence should not count *except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory*; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. (I now speak in such cases of ‘corroborating evidence’).

(@) Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, are still upheld by their admirers — for example by introducing *ad hoc* some auxiliary assumption, or by re-interpreting the theory *ad hoc* in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its scientific status. (I later described such a rescuing operation as a ‘*conventionalist twist*’ or
a ‘*conventionalist stratagem*’).

One can sum up all this by saying that **_the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability_**.
