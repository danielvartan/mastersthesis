To Professor Camilo Rodrigues Neto, for introducing me to and teaching me about the science of complex systems since 2012; for guiding my dissertation; for the patience and the virtue in taking on and mediating the process of transitioning my guidance in my master's degree after the breakdown of relations with my former supervisor.

To the local Student Movements, which truly support their category, unlike the National Association of Postgraduates (ANPG), the Association of Postgraduates (APG) Helenira 'Preta' Rezende of the University of São Paulo (USP), and the Central Directory of Students (DCE) Alexandre Vannucchi Leme of USP.

To the Support Program for Student Permanence and Education (PAPFE) of the University of São Paulo, which enabled me to get this far.
