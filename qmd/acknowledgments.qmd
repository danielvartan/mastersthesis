My Mother, for her unconditional love.

My friend and Professor [Humberto Miguel Garay Malpartida](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1164-2055), for his support; for his principles; and for his integrity, which was demonstrated when the need arose.

Professor [Camilo Rodrigues Neto](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6783-6695), for introducing me to and teaching me about the science of complex systems since 2012; for supervising my dissertation; for the patience and the virtue in taking on and mediating the process of transitioning my master's supervision after the breakdown of relations with my former supervisor.

[President Lula](https://lula.com.br/) (Yes!), who saved Brazil from fascism and approved the long-overdue adjustments to graduate scholarships.

The local student movements, which truly support their category.

The Support Program for Student Permanence and Education ([PAPFE](https://prip.usp.br/apoio-estudantil/)) of USP, which enabled me to get this far.
