## Overview

☀🌙⏰🛌💤🌍🗺️🧭📅🧬🧠🕰️📊📉📈📝

This repository contains the [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) of my master's thesis: _Is latitude associated with chronotype?_. The research compendium is also accessible via [The Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) by clicking [here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YGKTS)

The assemble of this repository was inspired by Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger & Lincoln Mullen's article [Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986).

## How to use

The analyses contained in this thesis are 100% reproducible. They were made using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and the  [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system. The [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package was used to ensure that the R environment used can be restored (see `renv.lock`). All the computational notebooks can be found in the `qmd` directory.

It's important to note that some restrictions apply to the availability of the  main research data, which contain personal and sensitive information. As a result, this data cannot be publicly shared. To run the analyses, users must have an internet connection and request a set of access keys from the author.

To reproduce the analyses do the following steps:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Open the R project (`mastersthesis.Rproj`).
1. Run [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv//reference/restore.html) to install all software dependencies.
1. Set all the keys provided by the author in the `.Renviron` file and the `_ssh` folder.
1. Open and run the analysis in the computational notebook.

If you don't feel comfortable with R, I strongly recommend checking Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's free and online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and the Coursera course from John Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r).
