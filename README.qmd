## Overview

‚òÄÔ∏èüåô‚è∞üõåüí§üåçüó∫Ô∏èüß≠üìÖüß¨üß†üï∞Ô∏èüìäüìì

This repository contains the [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) of my Master's Thesis: *Is Latitude Associated with Chronotype?* The research compendium is accessible via [The Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) by clicking [here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YGKTS).

The assemble of this repository was inspired by Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger & Lincoln Mullen's article [Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986).

## How to use

All analyses in this thesis are fully reproducible and were conducted using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) alongside the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system. The [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package was used to ensure that the R environment used can be restored (see `renv.lock`). All the computational notebooks can be found in the `qmd` directory.

It's important to note that some restrictions apply to the availability of the  main research data, which contain personal and sensitive information. As a result, this data cannot be publicly shared. To run the analyses, users must have an internet connection and request a set of access keys from the author (see *Keys* section).

If you don't feel comfortable with R, I strongly recommend checking Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's free and online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and the Coursera course from John Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r).

To reproduce the analyses do the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have the latest R version and the following R packages installed in your machine: `install.packages(c("cli", "here" ,"magrittr", "ragg", "renv", "stats", "stringr"))`.
1. Clone this repository.
1. Open the R project (`mastersthesis.Rproj`).
1. Run [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv//reference/restore.html) to install all software dependencies.
1. Set all the keys provided by the author in the `.Renviron` file and the `_ssh` folder.
1. Run `targets::tar_make()` to create every point of the data wrangling process (from the raw data to the cleaned and weighted data). 
1. Run any analysis present in the computational notebooks (`qmd` directory).

## Keys

To access the data and run the notebooks, you will need to set the following keys in the [`.Renviron`](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/set-up.html#:~:text=2.4.6%20The%20.Renviron%20file) file:

- `OSF_PAT`: Your [OSF](https://osf.io/) Personal Access Token (PAT). If you don't have one, go to the settings section of your OSF account and create a new token.
- `MASTERSTHESIS_PASSWORD`: The password for the project's RSA private key (32 bytes).

Additionally, you will need the following keys in the project's `_ssh` folder:

- `id_rsa`: The project's private RSA key (RSA 4096 bits (OpenSSL)).
- `id_rsa.pub`: The project's public RSA key.

These project's keys will be provided by the author of the thesis upon reasonable request. As reasonable requests, I consider those made by researchers with a legitimate interest in the thesis topic, whose projects are of high quality, ethically conducted, and who have obtained all necessary approvals for their research proposal.
