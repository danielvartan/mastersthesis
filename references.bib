  abstract = {The increase in the squared multiple correlation coefficient (ΔR 2) associated with a variable in a regression equation is a commonly used measure of importance in regression analysis. The coverage probability that an asymptotic and percentile bootstrap confidence interval includes Δρ2 was investigated. As expected, coverage probability for the asymptotic confidence interval was often inadequate (outside the interval .925 to .975 for a 95\% confidence interval), even when sample size was quite large (i.e., 200). However, adequate coverage probability for the confidence interval based on a bootstrap interval could typically be obtained with a sample size of 200 or less, and moreover, this accuracy was obtained with relatively small sample sizes (100 or less) with six or fewer predictors.},

If there is a second sample, \$y\_1, \textbackslash cdots, y\_M\$, a test of the hypothesis that the two samples come from the same (unspecified) continuous distribution can be based on the analogue of \$N\textbackslash omega\textasciicircum 2\$, namely \textbackslash begin\{equation*\}\textbackslash tag\{2\} T = \textbackslash lbrack NM/(N + M)\textbackslash rbrack \textbackslash int\textasciicircum\textbackslash infty\_\{-\textbackslash infty\} \textbackslash lbrack F\_N(x) - G\_M(x)\textbackslash rbrack\textasciicircum 2 dH\_\{N+M\}(x),\textbackslash end\{equation*\} where \$G\_M(x)\$ is the empirical distribution function of the second sample and \$H\_\{N+M\}(x)\$ is the empirical distribution function of the two samples together [that is, \$(N + M)H\_\{N+M\}(x) = NF\_N(x) + MG\_M(x)\textbackslash rbrack\$. The limiting distribution of \$N\textbackslash omega\textasciicircum 2\$ as \$N \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$ has been tabulated [2], and it has been shown ([3], [4a], and [7]) that \$T\$ has the same limiting distribution as \$N \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty, M \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$, and \$N/M \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash lambda\$, where \$\textbackslash lambda\$ is any finite positive constant. In this note we consider the distribution of \$T\$ for small values of \$N\$ and \$M\$ and present tables to permit use of the criterion at some conventional significance levels for small values of \$N\$ and \$M\$. The limiting distribution seems a surprisingly good approximation to the exact distribution for moderate sample sizes (corresponding to the same feature for \$N\textbackslash omega\textasciicircum 2\$ [6]). The accuracy of approximation is better than in the case of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic studied by Hodges [4].},

In this historical narrative, Charles Darwin is known for his investigations into the “sleep movements” of plants. Nevertheless, the complete scope of Darwin's exploration of biological rhythms remains incompletely understood. Through a detailed examination of Darwin's writings, meticulous observations, experiments, and conceptualizations, we unveil a depth of engagement that surpasses his widely acknowledged work on plants, revealing a more extensive interest in and insight into biological rhythms than traditionally recognized.},

Im Teil 1.1 werden die endogenen und exogenen Faktoren besprochen, die theoretisch die Phase zu beeinflussen vermögen. Die Überlegungen führen zu dem Schluß, daß das Licht-Dunkel-Verhältnis und die Dauer der Dämmerung im wesentlichen die Phase bestimmen. Experimentelle Belege sind in Teil 1.2 enthalten. In Teil 2 werden Freilandbeobachtungen über Beginn und Ende der Aktivität von Vögeln neu ausgewertet. Diese Ergebnisse, wie auch Meßwerte der Aktivität von Tieren in Innenräumen (Teil 3), stützen die Hypothese. Sie zeigen alle maximal voreilende Phasen im Mittsommer bei tagaktiven Arten bzw. im Mittwinter bei einer nachtaktiven Art. Einige, in Teil 4 erwähnte Ausnahmen von dieser Regel, werfen die Frage auf, in welchem Ausmaß die Ergebnisse verallgemeinert werden dürfen.

  abstract = {Many statistical models, and in particular autoregressive—moving average time series models, can be regarded as means of transforming the data to white noise, that is, to an uncorrected sequence of errors. If the parameters are known exactly, this random sequence can be computed directly from the observations; when this calculation is made with estimates substituted for the true parameter values, the resulting sequence is referred to as the “residuals,” which can be regarded as estimates of the errors. If the appropriate model has been chosen, there will be zero autocorrelation in the errors. In checking adequacy of fit it is therefore logical to study the sample autocorrelation function of the residuals. For large samples the residuals from a correctly fitted model resemble very closely the true errors of the process; however, care is needed in interpreting the serial correlations of the residuals. It is shown here that the residual autocorrelations are to a close approximation representable as a singular linear transformation of the autocorrelations of the errors so that they possess a singular normal distribution. Failing to allow for this results in a tendency to overlook evidence of lack of fit. Tests of fit and diagnostic checks are devised which take these facts into account.},

It includes the principles "less is more" (fewer variables, more highly targeted issues, sharp rounding off), "simple is better" (graphic representation, unit weighting for linear composites), and "some things you learn aren't so." I have learned to avoid the many misconceptions that surround Fisherian null hypothesis testing. I have also learned the importance of power analysis and the determination of just how big (rather than how statistically significant) are the effects that we study. Finally, I have learned that there is no royal road to statistical induction, that the informed judgment of the investigator is the crucial element in the interpretation of data, and that things take time.},

This article reviews the problems with this practice, including near universal misinterpretation of p as the probability that H₀ is false, the misinterpretation that its complement is the probability of successful replication, and the mistaken assumption that if one rejects H₀ one thereby affirms the theory that led to the test. Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods are suggested. For generalization, psychologists must finally rely, as has been done in all the older sciences, on replication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The test is an omnibus test, being appropriate to detect deviations from normality due either to skewness or kurtosis.

  abstract = {The circadian rhythms of melatonin and body temperature are set to an earlier hour in women than in men, even when the women and men maintain nearly identical and consistent bedtimes and wake times. Moreover, women tend to wake up earlier than men and exhibit a greater preference for morning activities than men. Although the neurobiological mechanism underlying this sex difference in circadian alignment is unknown, multiple studies in nonhuman animals have demonstrated a sex difference in circadian period that could account for such a difference in circadian alignment between women and men. Whether a sex difference in intrinsic circadian period in humans underlies the difference in circadian alignment between men and women is unknown. We analyzed precise estimates of intrinsic circadian period collected from 157 individuals (52 women, 105 men; aged 18–74 y) studied in a month-long inpatient protocol designed to minimize confounding influences on circadian period estimation. Overall, the average intrinsic period of the melatonin and temperature rhythms in this population was very close to 24 h [24.15 ± 0.2 h (24 h 9 min ± 12 min)]. We further found that the intrinsic circadian period was significantly shorter in women [24.09 ± 0.2 h (24 h 5 min ± 12 min)] than in men [24.19 ± 0.2 h (24 h 11 min ± 12 min);               P               {$<$} 0.01] and that a significantly greater proportion of women have intrinsic circadian periods shorter than 24.0 h (35\% vs. 14\%;               P               {$<$} 0.01). The shorter average intrinsic circadian period observed in women may have implications for understanding sex differences in habitual sleep duration and insomnia prevalence.},

  abstract = {The paper considers a number of problems arising from the test of serial correlation based on the d statistic proposed earlier by the authors (Durbin \&amp; Watson, 1950, 1951). Methods of computing the exact distribution of d are investigated and the exact distribution is compared with six approximations to it for four sets of published data. It is found that approximations suggested by Theil and Nagar and by Hannan are too inaccurate for practical use but that the beta approximation proposed in the 1950 and 1951 papers and a new approximation, called by us the a + bdu approximation and based, like the beta approximation, on the exact first two moments of d, both perform well.The power of the d test is compared with that of certain exact tests proposed by Theil, Durbin, Koerts and Abrahamse from the standpoint of invariance theory. It is shown that the d test is locally most powerful invariant but that the other tests are not.There are three appendices. The first gives an account of the exact distribution of d. The second derives the mean and variance to a second order of approximation of a modified maximum likelihood statistic closely related to d. The third sets out details of the computations required for the a + hdu approximation.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term "generative" is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both "inductive" and "deductive" science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling pro- vides a powerful way to address certain enduring-and especially interdisciplinary questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories-such as neoclassical microeconomics-to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise-or "map up"-to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based ("bottom up") models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theo- retical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent- based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science-some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since "emer- gence" figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible.},

  abstract = {Circannual variations in serum corticosterone levels in Balbc mice are demonstrated in pooled data of profiles involving at least 6 time points of sampling per 24-hour span. High values are found during the winter months and low values in late spring and summer. Cosinor analysis of the circadian rhythm of serum corticosterone during different times of the year shows a change in the circadian acrophase (crest) from about 43° in February to 95° in May. This change is evident after a seven-day standardization span at relatively constant temperatures and a regimen of LD12:12 with light from 0600 to 1800 (for mice kept previously under largely natural lighting conditions). This circannual variation in circadian acrophase is compared with the time required for a phase shift after an abrupt change in lighting regimen: after a 180° shift of the lighting regimen, the change in the serum corticosterone acrophase reaches 45° in less than three days, over 100° in 4 days and almost a full 180° in 7 days. Therefore, the circannual variation in circadian system phase of the adrenal cycle shown in this study cannot be regarded as an incomplete phase shift such as occurs shortly after an abrupt shift of the lighting regimen. The underlying mechanisms of this presumably partly intrinsic circannual biorhythm await further study.},

Results showed that Morning types and a significantly earlier peak time than Evening types and tended to have a higher daytime temperature and lower post peak temperature. The Intermediate type had temperatures between those of the other groups. Although no significant differences in sleep lengths were found between the three types, Morning types retired and arose significantly earlier than Evening types. Whilst these time significatly correlated with peak time, the questionnaire showed a higher peak time correlation. Although sleep habits are an important déterminant of peak time there are other contibutory factors, and these appear to be partly covered by the questionnaire. Although the questionnaire appears to be valid, further evaluation using a wider subject population is required.},

We also discuss why one should be very cautious when using statistical tests to check the assumptions.},

Due to the tilt in the earth’s axis in relation to the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun, sunlight reaches the Earth differentially depending on the latitude. The timing of circadian rhythms varies among individuals of a given population and biological and environmental factors underlie this variability. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that latitude is associated to the regulation of circadian rhythm in humans. We have studied chronotype profiles across latitudinal cline from around 0° to 32° South in Brazil in a sample of 12,884 volunteers living in the same time zone. The analysis of the results revealed that humans are sensitive to the different sunlight signals tied to differences in latitude, resulting in a morning to evening latitudinal cline of chronotypes towards higher latitudes.},

There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the p-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, p-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on p-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low p-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the p-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay. We believe that addressing the p-value problem will increase the credibility of large sample IS research as well as provide more insights for readers.},

  abstract = {Biomedical research has come to rely on p-values as a deterministic measure for data-driven decision-making. In the largely extended null hypothesis significance testing for identifying statistically significant differences among groups of observations, a single p-value is computed from sample data. Then, it is routinely compared with a threshold, commonly set to 0.05, to assess the evidence against the hypothesis of having non-significant differences among groups, or the null hypothesis. Because the estimated p-value tends to decrease when the sample size is increased, applying this methodology to datasets with large sample sizes results in the rejection of the null hypothesis, making it not meaningful in this specific situation. We propose a new approach to detect differences based on the dependence of the p-value on the sample size. We introduce new descriptive parameters that overcome the effect of the size in the p-value interpretation in the framework of datasets with large sample sizes, reducing the uncertainty in the decision about the existence of biological differences between the compared experiments. The methodology enables the graphical and quantitative characterization of the differences between the compared experiments guiding the researchers in the decision process. An in-depth study of the methodology is carried out on simulated and experimental data. Code availability at https://github.com/BIIG-UC3M/pMoSS.},

  abstract = {A primeira edição do Atlas Brasileiro de Energia Solar foi lançada em 2006 com base em 10 anos de dados dos satélites da série GOES e no modelo físico de transferência radiativa BRASIL-SR, validado com dados observados em 98 estações meteorológicas operadas pelo INMET (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia) e espalhadas por todo território nacional. Na época do lançamento, a rede SONDA (Sistema de Organização Nacional de Dados Ambientais), operada pelo INPE, havia recém entrado em operação e contribuiu no processo de validação com apenas três anos de dados solarimétricos das 3 componentes da irradiação solar na superfície: global horizontal, direta normal e difusa. Essa edição pioneira do Atlas constituiu um marco importante no histórico da energia solar no Brasil e é, ainda hoje, empregada por vários investigadores e empreendedores da área de energia solar. Após mais de 10 anos, o Centro de Ciência do Sistema Terrestre (CCST) do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), através do seu Laboratório de Modelagem e Estudos de Recursos Renováveis de Energia (LABREN), tem a satisfação de publicar a segunda edição, ampliada e revisada, do Atlas Brasileiro de Energia Solar. Trata-se de um exemplo de trabalho cooperativo entre o INPE e pesquisadores de várias instituições no Brasil: a Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), a Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), a Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR) e o Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina (IFSC). Para essa nova edição, foram empregados mais de 17 anos de dados satelitais e implementados vários avanços nas parametrizações do modelo de transferência radiativa BRASIL-SR, visando melhorar ainda mais a confiabilidade e acurácia da base de dados produzida e disponibilizada para acesso público. Além desses avanços, a nova versão contém análises sobre os níveis de confiança, sobre a variabilidade espacial e temporal do recurso solar, além de apresentar cenários de emprego de várias tecnologias solares. Embora o foco do Atlas seja a área de energia, os dados apresentados também atendem usuários em várias outras áreas de conhecimento, como a meteorologia, climatologia, agricultura, hidrologia e arquitetura. Este Atlas contou com a contribuição científica do Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia para Mudanças Climáticas (INCT-MC), através dos processos CNPq 573797/2008-0 e FAPESP 2008/57719-9, o qual apoiou a fase de pesquisa, consolidação e de sua montagem final. Não podemos também deixar de agradecer e de partilhar esse momento com o Centro de Pesquisas da Petrobras (CENPES) que, através do Projeto ANEEL PD-0553-0013/2010 com o INPE, forneceu o importante suporte financeiro para o aprimoramento do modelo BRASIL-SR, assim como para a expansão, operação e manutenção da rede solarimétrica SONDA. Os créditos também são endereçados à Rede Brasileira de Pesquisas sobre Mudanças Climáticas Globais, através do convênio FINEP / Rede CLIMA 01.13.0353-00, pelo suporte na fase de rodadas do modelo, e aos demais colegas do INPE, particularmente do Laboratório de Instrumentação Meteorológica (LIM), do Centro de Previsão de Tempo e Estudos Climáticos (CPTEC), que forneceram suporte logístico a esse trabalho desde a primeira edição do Atlas. Agradecemos também o apoio institucional da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL) e da International Solar Energy Society (ISES) pelo reconhecimento do mérito científico dessa publicação como marco importante para a penetração da tecnologia solar no Brasil.Os autores e as entidades de suporte e apoio que possibilitaram mais essa edição do Atlas esperam que esse trabalho constitua mais um importante marco para o avanço da tecnologia solar no Brasil.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms (CRs) are fundamental biological processes that significantly impact human well-being. Disruption of these rhythms can trigger insufficient neurocognitive development, insomnia, mental disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic dysfunctions, and cancer. The field of chronobiology has increased our understanding of how rhythm disturbances contribute to cancer pathogenesis, and how circadian timing influences the efficacy of cancer treatments. As the circadian clock steadily gains recognition as an emerging factor in tumorigenesis, a thorough and comprehensive multi-omics analysis of CR genes/proteins has never been performed. To shed light on this, we performed, for the first time, an integrated data analysis encompassing genomic/transcriptomic alterations across 32 cancer types (n\,=\,10,918 tumors) taken from the PanCancer Atlas, unfavorable prognostic protein analysis, protein–protein interactomics, and shortest distance score pathways to cancer hallmark phenotypes. This data mining strategy allowed us to unravel 31 essential CR-related proteins involved in the signaling crossroad between circadian rhythms and cancer. In the context of drugging the clock, we identified pharmacogenomic clinical annotations and drugs currently in late phase clinical trials that could be considered as potential cancer therapeutic strategies. These findings highlight the diverse roles of CR-related genes/proteins in the realm of cancer research and therapy.},

Little change seems possible once the procedure becomes well ingrained in the minds and current practice of researchers; thus, the optimal opportunity for such change is at the time the procedure is taught, be this at undergraduate or at postgraduate levels. This paper presents a tutorial for the teaching of data testing procedures, often referred to as hypothesis testing theories. The first procedure introduced is Fisher's approach to data testing—tests of significance; the second is Neyman-Pearson's approach—tests of acceptance; the final procedure is the incongruent combination of the previous two theories into the current approach—NSHT. For those researchers sticking with the latter, two compromise solutions on how to improve NHST conclude the tutorial.},

  abstract = {This paper develops several propositions concerning the lability of the amplitude of Drosophila circadian pacemakers. The first is that the amplitude of the pacemaker's motion, unlike its period, is markedly temperature-dependent. The second is that latitudinal variation in pacemaker amplitude (higher in the north) is responsible for two very different sets of observations on Drosophila circadian systems at successively higher latitudes. One of these is a cline in D. auraria's phase-shifting response to light, which steadily weakens in a succession of more northerly strains. The other, concerning D. littoralis in the very far north, is a cline in the rate at which eclosion activity becomes arrhythmic (the circadian rhythm damps out) in constant darkness; damping is faster in the north.             The third proposition concerns a plausible selection pressure for the cline in pacemaker amplitude that we propose underlies the two directly observed clines. Two points are emphasized: (1) The amplitude of the pacemaker's daily oscillation declines as the duration of the entraining light pulse (photoperiod) is increased; and (2) the duration of the daily photoperiods throughout the breeding season is steadily increased as one moves toward the poles. Selection for conservation of pacemaker amplitude (during the breeding season) would produce the latitudinal cline we propose. The fourth, and final proposition is that since the amplitude of the pacemaker's daily motion responds systematically to change in photoperiod, amplitude is clearly one way—and a temperature-dependent way—in which insect circadian systems may sense seasonal change.             These propositions concerning the temperature and latitude dependence of pacemaker amplitude may be relevant to a wider array of circadian pacemakers than Drosophila.},

The “environment hypothesis” suggests that M/E is dependent on environmental factors, such as latitude, mean average temperature and photoperiod. We here analyzed a large number of datasets to assess this effect based on a systematic review. Data were from a total of 87 datasets and 35,589 individuals based on 28 countries. Partial correlations correcting for age revealed significant relationships between M/E and latitude, mean yearly temperature, photoperiod and sunset. Evening orientation was related to higher latitude, longer days and later sunset. Morning orientation was related to higher average temperatures. Percentage of females and sunrise time had no significant influence. These variables (sunset, temperature, photoperiod) were then input in a general linear model. The full model showed an influence of age and of sunset on CSM scores, but not of photoperiod and average temperature. Sunset, therefore, seems to be the most important statistical predictor for the observed latitudinal gradient.},

  abstract = {Sleep represents an essential element for health and well-being, including cognitive performance, physiological processes, emotional regulation, physical development, and quality of life and is the best observed circadian rhythm in humans. Humans show large differences in the preferred timing of their sleep and activity, so-called chronotypes. Ranging from extreme early types to extreme late chronotypes, the majority falls between these extremes. While chronotype and sleep necessity appear to be independent characteristics, the difference in sleep duration between workdays and work-free days is nonetheless chronotype-dependent because of our social schedules. Extremely earlier chronotype experience shorter sleep duration on free-days and longer on workdays. On the other hand, the later chronotypes have shorter sleep duration on workdays and longer on free days. Its described in literature that chronotypes become later from eastern to western border of time zones. The social time is equal, whereas solar time is progressively delayed, producing a later phase of entrainment and increased discrepancies between individuals' social and biological circadian times, that can lead to a higher circadian disruption with potential health detriments. Portugal is in Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT) time zone, the second most western and the most southern country, so it is expected that the Portuguese might be especially late chronotypes. Therefore, to explore their sleep/chronotype is of major interest. The studies present in this thesis aimed to characterize the sleep/wake phases of the Portuguese general population as well as in sleep medicine patients and to compare them with other countries/samples. The characterization of a clinical sample of extreme late chronotypes and to evaluate how much the social clocks influence the sleep quality in sleep disorder patients were also objectives of this thesis. In order to accomplish these objectives five different studies were performed: Study 1) Aiming to evaluate self-reported average sleep duration (n= 5,436 adults; EpiDoC3 cohort) and its possible associations with demographic features and chronic medical disorders. Cross-sectional, populational based study. The prevalence for Short Sleep Duration (SSD) was high (20.7\%) and for Long Sleep Duration (LSD) (5.9\%) was relatively low. Being older, with lower education, retired and unemployed were associated to SSD and LSD (p{$<$}0.01). Being obese was associated to SSD as well as hypertension, gastrointestinal disease and hypercholesterolemia (p{$<$}0.01). SSD and LSD, were associated with diabetes (p{$<$}0.01 and p=0.03, respectively) and with depression (p{$<$}0.01 and p=0.02, respectively). Cardiovascular disease (p{$<$}0.01) was associated to LSD. Multimorbidity was associated to SSD (p{$<$}0.01). Worse quality of life and bad physical function were associated to SSD and LSD, as well as being hospitalized in the previous 12 months (p{$<$}0.01). Study 2) Aimed at understanding if the reported “usual” sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) reflects workdays sleep of sleep disorder patients and to find a social influence on sleep quality detriment of these patients. Cross-sectional, case- control study. 431 sleep disorder patients and 338 subjects from the general population answered three variants of the PSQI (usual (u), work (w), work-free (f) days) and the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). PSQI scores differed between groups (p{$<$}0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between PSQIu vs. PSQIf and PSQIw vs. PSQIf with PSQIf presenting lower scores, while PSQIu vs. PSQIw did not differ in any group. In line with previous findings, Social Jetlag (SJL) was associated to PSQIdiff in sleep disorder patients. Study 3) Aimed at validating the Portuguese variant of the MCTQ. Cross-sectional observational study, including the, 80 Portuguese individuals from the general population with 4 weeks of actimetry and MCTQ; The median mid-point of sleep, chronotype (MSFsc) was 4:33 (abs range: 2:04 – 8:45). The 1st quartile was earlier than 3:43, and the 4th quartile later than 5:15. Extreme chronotypes (2.5\% at each end of the distribution) were earlier than 2:20 and later than 8:36. Comparing the average chronotype of Portuguese subjects with other countries, the Korean’s were the latest (MSFsc = 5:07) followed by the Portuguese (MSFsc = 4:37), the German (MSFsc = 4:22) and the Japanese (MSFsc = 4:18). For the extreme late chronotypes the Portuguese (8:36) was later than the late 2.5\% in the Korean sample (8:34). High correlations between MCTQPT and actimetry derived data were found showing that the MCTQ was a reliable questionnaire to access sleep timings and phase of entrainment for the Portuguese adult population. Study 4) Aimed at characterizing a clinical population of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) patients. In 5 years of registries 245 patients with DSWPD were identified and 162 patients had performed at least one objective sleep/wake/phase measure (actimetry, DLMO, PSG). Gender differences for the different age groups (p=0.028) were observed. Men were more likely to be single and women more likely to be married (p=0.034). In students, school failure was higher for women (p{$<$}0.001); for workers, absenteeism was higher in women (p=0.001). In the circadian aligned (compared to misaligned group), DLMO was later (p{$<$}0.001), sleep onset time (p=0.046) was later, total sleep time (p=0.035), and number of sleep cycles (p=0.018) were lower, as measured using PSG T1. Study 5) Aimed at comparing 9 European countries in relation to chronotype, average sleep duration and social jetlag. Cross-sectional observational study. 164,234 individuals from the MCTQ-database (8 countries) and a sample of Icelanders (total n=165,378).  The average chronotype among the studied countries ranged between 3.97 ± 1.16 for Belgium and 5.15 ± 0.25 for Spain, for the Central European Greenwich Meridian Time zone (GMT+1) and between 4.21 ± 1.41 for the United Kingdom and 4.76 ± 1.46 for Portugal among the GMT countries. The average Sleep Duration ranged between 7.36 ± 0.21 for Spain and 7.67 ± 0.95 for Belgium, for the GMT+1 and between 7.33 ± 1.05 for Ireland and 8.12 ± 2.42 for Portugal, among the GMT countries. The average SJL ranged between 1.32 ± 0.92 for Netherland and 1.65 ± 0.16, for Spain for the GMT+1 and between 1.24 ± 0.93 for United Kingdom and 1.70 ± 0.86 for Iceland among the GMT countries. In conclusion, the work in this dissertation showed the associations to self-reported total sleep time and chronic diseases and poor health quality to the Portuguese population. A negative social influence on reported sleep quality of Portuguese sleep disorder patients was present. Social jetlag was a predictor for poor sleep quality, mediated by chronotype. We suggest that treatment strategies addressing social aspects affecting sleep quality on workdays and minimizing actions for circadian strain would be of major importance on sleep medicine clinical practice. Late type seems to be common among the Portuguese and this was shown not only for subjective data as well as by objective data. Recommendations is something that needs to be considered in our society since it can cause a circadian misalignment, when leaving against our biological clocks. The causes of circadian misalignment and health detriments were well shown in this thesis and have an economic impact measured by the absenteeism and hospitalizations of the EpiReuma study, which should more precisely evaluated in future studies. Sleep education and awareness campaigns are needed for Portugal (general population, physicians, employers and policy makers) in order to advertise to this lateness predisposition, find countermeasures strategies and advertise for health consequences of leaving against the clock.},

  abstract = {Human behavior shows large interindividual variation in temporal organization. Extreme “larks” wake up when extreme “owls” fall asleep. These chronotypes are attributed to differences in the circadian clock, and in animals, the genetic basis of similar phenotypic differences is well established. To better understand the genetic basis of temporal organization in humans, the authors developed a questionnaire to document individual sleep times, self-reported light exposure, and self-assessed chronotype, considering work and free days separately. This report summarizes the results of 500 questionnaires completed in a pilot study. Individual sleep times show large differences between work and free days, except for extreme early types. During the workweek, late chronotypes accumulate considerable sleep debt, for which they compensate on free days by lengthening their sleep by several hours. For all chronotypes, the amount of time spent outdoors in broad daylight significantly affects the timing of sleep: Increased self-reported light exposure advances sleep. The timing of self-selected sleep is multifactorial, including genetic disposition, sleep debt accumulated on workdays, and light exposure. Thus, accurate assessment of genetic chronotypes has to incorporate all of these parameters. The dependence of human chronotype on light, that is, on the amplitude of the light:dark signal, follows the known characteristics of circadian systems in all other experimental organisms. Our results predict that the timing of sleep has changed during industrialization and that a majority of humans are sleep deprived during the workweek. The implications are far ranging concerning learning, memory, vigilance, performance, and quality of life.},

  abstract = {The traditional approaches to predict entrainment of circadian clocks by light are based on 2 concepts that were never successfully unified: the non-parametric approach assumes that entrainment occurs via discrete daily phase shifts while the parametric approach assumes that entrainment involves changes of the clock’s velocity. Here the authors suggest a new approach to predict and model entrainment. Unlike the traditional approaches, it does not assume a priori the mechanism of how the internal and external cycle lengths are matched (via phase shifts, velocity changes, or even other mechanisms). It is based on a circadian integrated response characteristic (CIRC) that describes how the circadian system integrates light signals at different circadian phases, without specifying exactly when and how fast its progression is affected. Light around subjective dawn compresses the internal cycle; light around subjective dusk expands it. While the phase response curve (PRC) describes the results of experiments using light stimuli (of specified duration and intensity), the CIRC reflects how the system integrates any given light profile, be it single pulses or any form of light-dark cycle (from skeleton photoperiods to natural light profiles). CIRCs are characterized by their shape (determining the extent of their dead zone) and their asymmetry (the ratio of its compressing and expanding portions). They are dimensionless (time/time), and their maximum is by definition 1. To make predictions about entrainment, the CIRC is multiplied with the light intensity/sensitivity at any given time point. Unlike the PRC and the velocity response curve, the CIRC can be assessed on the basis of entrained steady states, by modeling experimental results. The CIRC approach makes several predictions that can be tested experimentally.},

Additionally, its online version, which was available until July 2017, produced almost 300,000 entries from all over the world (MCTQ database). The MCTQ has gone through several versions, has been translated into 13 languages, and has been validated against other more objective measures of daily timing in several independent studies. Besides being used as a method to correlate circadian features of human biology with other factors—ranging from health issues to geographical factors—the MCTQ gave rise to the quantification of old wisdoms, like “teenagers are late”, and has produced new concepts, like social jetlag. Some like the MCTQ’s simplicity and some view it critically. Therefore, it is time to present a self-critical view on the MCTQ, to address some misunderstandings, and give some definitions of the MCTQ-derived chronotype and the concept of social jetlag.},

  abstract = {Statistical methods generally have assumptions (e.g., normality in linear regression models). Violations of these assumptions can cause various issues, like statistical errors and biased estimates, whose impact can range from inconsequential to critical. Accordingly, it is important to check these assumptions, but this is often done in a flawed way. Here, I first present a prevalent but problematic approach to diagnostics—testing assumptions using null hypothesis significance tests (e.g., the Shapiro–Wilk test of normality). Then, I consolidate and illustrate the issues with this approach, primarily using simulations. These issues include statistical errors (i.e., false positives, especially with large samples, and false negatives, especially with small samples), false binarity, limited descriptiveness, misinterpretation (e.g., of p-value as an~effect size), and potential testing failure due to unmet test assumptions. Finally, I synthesize the implications of these issues for statistical diagnostics, and provide practical recommendations for improving such diagnostics. Key recommendations include maintaining awareness of the issues with assumption tests (while recognizing they can be useful), using appropriate combinations of diagnostic methods (including visualization and effect sizes) while recognizing their limitations, and distinguishing between testing and checking assumptions. Additional recommendations include judging assumption violations as a complex spectrum (rather than a simplistic binary), using programmatic tools that increase replicability and decrease researcher degrees of freedom, and sharing the material and rationale involved in the diagnostics.},

Diagnostics for regression models are tools that assess a model’s compliance to its assumptions and investigate if there is a single observation or group of observations that are not well represented by the model. These tools allow researchers to evaluate if a model appropriately represents the data of their study. In this book we separate diagnostics from the other parts of model selection to provide a focus on this important topic. This separation is not meant to imply that these tools are used separately from other regression modeling tools.},
