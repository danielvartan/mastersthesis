  {"id":"leocadio-miguel_2017","abstract":"Abstract\n            The rotation of the Earth around its own axis and around the sun determines the characteristics of the light/dark cycle, the most stable and ancient 24 h temporal cue for all organisms. Due to the tilt in the earth’s axis in relation to the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun, sunlight reaches the Earth differentially depending on the latitude. The timing of circadian rhythms varies among individuals of a given population and biological and environmental factors underlie this variability. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that latitude is associated to the regulation of circadian rhythm in humans. We have studied chronotype profiles across latitudinal cline from around 0° to 32° South in Brazil in a sample of 12,884 volunteers living in the same time zone. The analysis of the results revealed that humans are sensitive to the different sunlight signals tied to differences in latitude, resulting in a morning to evening latitudinal cline of chronotypes towards higher latitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Leocadio-Miguel","given":"Mario André"},{"family":"Louzada","given":"Fernando Mazzili"},{"family":"Duarte","given":"Leandro Lourenção"},{"family":"Areas","given":"Roberta Peixoto"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Marilene"},{"family":"Freire","given":"Marcelo Ventura"},{"family":"Fontenele-Araujo","given":"John"},{"family":"Menna-Barreto","given":"Luiz"},{"family":"Pedrazzoli","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"leocadio-miguel_2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-05797-w","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,14]]},"language":"en","page":"5437","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Latitudinal cline of chronotype","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05797-w","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"pittendrigh_1991","abstract":"This paper develops several propositions concerning the lability of the amplitude of Drosophila circadian pacemakers. The first is that the amplitude of the pacemaker's motion, unlike its period, is markedly temperature-dependent. The second is that latitudinal variation in pacemaker amplitude (higher in the north) is responsible for two very different sets of observations on Drosophila circadian systems at successively higher latitudes. One of these is a cline in D. auraria's phase-shifting response to light, which steadily weakens in a succession of more northerly strains. The other, concerning D. littoralis in the very far north, is a cline in the rate at which eclosion activity becomes arrhythmic (the circadian rhythm damps out) in constant darkness; damping is faster in the north.\n            The third proposition concerns a plausible selection pressure for the cline in pacemaker amplitude that we propose underlies the two directly observed clines. Two points are emphasized: (1) The amplitude of the pacemaker's daily oscillation declines as the duration of the entraining light pulse (photoperiod) is increased; and (2) the duration of the daily photoperiods throughout the breeding season is steadily increased as one moves toward the poles. Selection for conservation of pacemaker amplitude (during the breeding season) would produce the latitudinal cline we propose. The fourth, and final proposition is that since the amplitude of the pacemaker's daily motion responds systematically to change in photoperiod, amplitude is clearly one way—and a temperature-dependent way—in which insect circadian systems may sense seasonal change.\n            These propositions concerning the temperature and latitude dependence of pacemaker amplitude may be relevant to a wider array of circadian pacemakers than Drosophila.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pittendrigh","given":"Colin S."},{"family":"Kyner","given":"Walter T."},{"family":"Takamura","given":"Tsuguhiko"}],"citation-key":"pittendrigh_1991","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","container-title-short":"J Biol Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/074873049100600402","ISSN":"0748-7304, 1552-4531","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,12]]},"language":"en","page":"299-313","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The amplitude of circadian oscillations: temperature dependence, latitudinal clines, and the photoperiodic time measurement","title-short":"The Amplitude of Circadian Oscillations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/074873049100600402","volume":"6"},

We here analyzed a large number of datasets to assess this effect based on a systematic review. Data were from a total of 87 datasets and 35,589 individuals based on 28 countries. Partial correlations correcting for age revealed significant relationships between M/E and latitude, mean yearly temperature, photoperiod and sunset. Evening orientation was related to higher latitude, longer days and later sunset. Morning orientation was related to higher average temperatures. Percentage of females and sunrise time had no significant influence. These variables (sunset, temperature, photoperiod) were then input in a general linear model. The full model showed an influence of age and of sunset on CSM scores, but not of photoperiod and average temperature.

  {"id":"roenneberg_2003","abstract":"Human behavior shows large interindividual variation in temporal organization. Extreme “larks” wake up when extreme “owls” fall asleep. These chronotypes are attributed to differences in the circadian clock, and in animals, the genetic basis of similar phenotypic differences is well established. To better understand the genetic basis of temporal organization in humans, the authors developed a questionnaire to document individual sleep times, self-reported light exposure, and self-assessed chronotype, considering work and free days separately. This report summarizes the results of 500 questionnaires completed in a pilot study. Individual sleep times show large differences between work and free days, except for extreme early types. During the workweek, late chronotypes accumulate considerable sleep debt, for which they compensate on free days by lengthening their sleep by several hours. For all chronotypes, the amount of time spent outdoors in broad daylight significantly affects the timing of sleep: Increased self-reported light exposure advances sleep. The timing of self-selected sleep is multifactorial, including genetic disposition, sleep debt accumulated on workdays, and light exposure. Thus, accurate assessment of genetic chronotypes has to incorporate all of these parameters. The dependence of human chronotype on light, that is, on the amplitude of the light:dark signal, follows the known characteristics of circadian systems in all other experimental organisms. Our results predict that the timing of sleep has changed during industrialization and that a majority of humans are sleep deprived during the workweek. The implications are far ranging concerning learning, memory, vigilance, performance, and quality of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Roenneberg","given":"Till"},{"family":"Wirz-Justice","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Merrow","given":"Martha"}],"citation-key":"roenneberg_2003","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","container-title-short":"J Biol Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/0748730402239679","ISSN":"0748-7304, 1552-4531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,2]]},"language":"en","page":"80-90","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Life between clocks: daily temporal patterns of human chronotypes","title-short":"Life between Clocks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730402239679","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"roenneberg_2010","abstract":"The traditional approaches to predict entrainment of circadian clocks by light are based on 2 concepts that were never successfully unified: the non-parametric approach assumes that entrainment occurs via discrete daily phase shifts while the parametric approach assumes that entrainment involves changes of the clock’s velocity. Here the authors suggest a new approach to predict and model entrainment. Unlike the traditional approaches, it does not assume a priori the mechanism of how the internal and external cycle lengths are matched (via phase shifts, velocity changes, or even other mechanisms). It is based on a circadian integrated response characteristic (CIRC) that describes how the circadian system integrates light signals at different circadian phases, without specifying exactly when and how fast its progression is affected. Light around subjective dawn compresses the internal cycle; light around subjective dusk expands it. While the phase response curve (PRC) describes the results of experiments using light stimuli (of specified duration and intensity), the CIRC reflects how the system integrates any given light profile, be it single pulses or any form of light-dark cycle (from skeleton photoperiods to natural light profiles). CIRCs are characterized by their shape (determining the extent of their dead zone) and their asymmetry (the ratio of its compressing and expanding portions). They are dimensionless (time/time), and their maximum is by definition 1. To make predictions about entrainment, the CIRC is multiplied with the light intensity/sensitivity at any given time point. Unlike the PRC and the velocity response curve, the CIRC can be assessed on the basis of entrained steady states, by modeling experimental results. The CIRC approach makes several predictions that can be tested experimentally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Roenneberg","given":"Till"},{"family":"Hut","given":"Roelof"},{"family":"Daan","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Merrow","given":"Martha"}],"citation-key":"roenneberg_2010","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","container-title-short":"J Biol Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/0748730410379082","ISSN":"0748-7304, 1552-4531","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"language":"en","page":"329-339","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Entrainment concepts revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730410379082","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"roenneberg_2019","abstract":"The Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) has now been available for more than 15 years and its original publication has been cited 1240 times (Google Scholar, May 2019). Additionally, its online version, which was available until July 2017, produced almost 300,000 entries from all over the world (MCTQ database). The MCTQ has gone through several versions, has been translated into 13 languages, and has been validated against other more objective measures of daily timing in several independent studies. Besides being used as a method to correlate circadian features of human biology with other factors—ranging from health issues to geographical factors—the MCTQ gave rise to the quantification of old wisdoms, like “teenagers are late”, and has produced new concepts, like social jetlag. Some like the MCTQ’s simplicity and some view it critically. Therefore, it is time to present a self-critical view on the MCTQ, to address some misunderstandings, and give some definitions of the MCTQ-derived chronotype and the concept of social jetlag.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Roenneberg","given":"Till"},{"family":"Pilz","given":"Luísa K."},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Winnebeck","given":"Eva C."}],"citation-key":"roenneberg_2019","container-title":"Biology","container-title-short":"Biology","DOI":"10.3390/biology8030054","ISSN":"2079-7737","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,12]]},"language":"en","page":"54","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chronotype and social jetlag: a (self-) critical review","title-short":"Chronotype and Social Jetlag","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/8/3/54","volume":"8"},

A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.
