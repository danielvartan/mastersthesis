  {"id":"fido2008","abstract":"Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the detrimental effects of working a varying pattern of 8-hour shifts on quality of sleep, general health and work performance. <i>Subjects and Methods:</i> The Arabic version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)and 2 self-administered questionnaires were used to assess quality of sleep, work performance and general health in a sample of 200 males on a schedule of varying 8-hour shifts at the Kuwait Oil Company. A matched sample of an equal number of workers on a fixed daytime shift as a control group was enrolled in the study. <i>Results:</i> Compared with men working on a straight daytime shift schedule, those working on 8-hour variable shifts exhibited higher rates of heavy smoking (p < 0.003), coffee/tea consumption (p < 0.0001), constipation (p < 0.002), job stress (p < 0.0001) and poor sexual performance (p < 0.0001). Variable-shift workers reported persistent sleep disturbances in 3 dimensions of the global score of the PSQI (p < 0.0001). They also had significantly more complaints of fatigue (p < 0.005), poor level of work performance (p < 0.005) and loss of concentration (p < 0.005). Shift workers were significantly more prone to making errors and having accidents at work, and were more likely to report absence from work than the controls (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.005, respectively). <i>Conclusion:</i> These results suggest that the majority of workers on an 8-hour variable-shift schedule experienced various health problems, poor quality of sleep and an increased risk for errors and accidents at work as compared with those workers on a straight daytime shift schedule. There is a need to compare potential benefits of an alternative work shift schedule.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Fido","given":"Abdullahi"},{"family":"Ghali","given":"Adel"}],"citation-key":"fido2008","container-title":"Medical Principles and Practice","container-title-short":"Med Princ Pract","DOI":"10.1159/000151566","ISSN":"1011-7571, 1423-0151","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","page":"453-457","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Detrimental effects of variable work shifts on quality of sleep, general health and work performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/151566","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"horne1976","abstract":"An English language self-assessment Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire is presented and evaluated against individual differences in the circadian vatiation of oral temperature. 48 subjects falling into Morning, Evening and Intermediate type categories regularly took their temperature. Circadian peak time were identified from the smoothed temperature curves of each subject. Results showed that Morning types and a significantly earlier peak time than Evening types and tended to have a higher daytime temperature and lower post peak temperature. The Intermediate type had temperatures between those of the other groups. Although no significant differences in sleep lengths were found between the three types, Morning types retired and arose significantly earlier than Evening types. Whilst these time significatly correlated with peak time, the questionnaire showed a higher peak time correlation. Although sleep habits are an important déterminant of peak time there are other contibutory factors, and these appear to be partly covered by the questionnaire. Although the questionnaire appears to be valid, further evaluation using a wider subject population is required.","author":[{"family":"Horne","given":"J.

  {"id":"kuhn2022","abstract":"Get going with tidymodels, a collection of R packges for modeling and machine learning. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience with modeling, this practical introduction shows data analysts, business analysts, and data scientists how the tidymodels framework offers a consistent, flexible approach for your work. RStudio engineers Max Kuhn and Julia Silge demonstrate ways to create models by focusing on an R dialect called the tidyverse. Software that adops tidyverse principles shares both a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so learning one piece of the ecosystem makes it easier to learn the next. You'll understand why the tidymodels framework has been built to be used by a broad range of people.","author":[{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Max"},{"family":"Silge","given":"Julia"}],"call-number":"Q325.5 .K84 2022","citation-key":"kuhn2022","event-place":"Sebastopol, CA","ISBN":"978-1-4920-9648-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: on1338675673","number-of-pages":"363","publisher":"O'Reilly Media","publisher-place":"Sebastopol, CA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Tidy modeling with R: a framework for modeling in the tidyverse","title-short":"Tidy modeling with R","type":"book","URL":"https://www.tmwr.org/"},

  {"id":"leocadio-miguel2017","abstract":"Abstract\n            The rotation of the Earth around its own axis and around the sun determines the characteristics of the light/dark cycle, the most stable and ancient 24 h temporal cue for all organisms. Due to the tilt in the earth’s axis in relation to the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun, sunlight reaches the Earth differentially depending on the latitude. The timing of circadian rhythms varies among individuals of a given population and biological and environmental factors underlie this variability. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that latitude is associated to the regulation of circadian rhythm in humans. We have studied chronotype profiles across latitudinal cline from around 0° to 32° South in Brazil in a sample of 12,884 volunteers living in the same time zone. The analysis of the results revealed that humans are sensitive to the different sunlight signals tied to differences in latitude, resulting in a morning to evening latitudinal cline of chronotypes towards higher latitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Leocadio-Miguel","given":"Mario André"},{"family":"Louzada","given":"Fernando Mazzili"},{"family":"Duarte","given":"Leandro Lourenção"},{"family":"Areas","given":"Roberta Peixoto"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Marilene"},{"family":"Freire","given":"Marcelo Ventura"},{"family":"Fontenele-Araujo","given":"John"},{"family":"Menna-Barreto","given":"Luiz"},{"family":"Pedrazzoli","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"leocadio-miguel2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-05797-w","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,14]]},"language":"en","page":"5437","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Latitudinal cline of chronotype","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05797-w","volume":"7"},

Evidence on other common cancers, such as prostate cancer, is scarce. Chronotype is an individual characteristic that may relate to night work adaptation. We evaluated night shift work with relation to prostate cancer, taking into account chronotype and disease severity in a population based case‐control study in Spain. We included 1,095 prostate cancer cases and 1,388 randomly selected population controls. We collected detailed information on shift schedules (permanent\n              vs\n              . rotating, time schedules, duration, frequency), using lifetime occupational history. Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were assessed by face‐to‐face interviews and chronotype through a validated questionnaire. We used unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. Subjects who had worked at least for one year in night shift work had a slightly higher prostate cancer risk [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.14; 95%CI 0.94, 1.37] compared with never night workers; this risk increased with longer duration of exposure (≥28 years: OR 1.37; 95%CI 1.05, 1.81;\n              p\n              ‐trend = 0.047). Risks were more pronounced for high risk tumors [D'Amico classification, Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) 1.40; 95%CI 1.05, 1.86], particularly among subjects with longer duration of exposure (≥28 years: RRR 1.63; 95%CI 1.08, 2.45;\n              p\n              ‐trend = 0.027). Overall risk was higher among subjects with an evening chronotype, but also increased in morning chronotypes after long‐term night work. In this large population based study, we found an association between night shift work and prostate cancer particularly for tumors with worse prognosis.\n            \n          , \n            \n              What's new?\n            \n            \n              Up to 20% of workers do night‐shift work, which may increase the risk of some cancers. In this study, the authors found that long‐term night‐shift work was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and decreased survival. Overall risk was higher among workers with an evening chronotype (\n              i.e\n              ., a preference for working in the evening\n              vs\n              . in the morning), but risk also increased for morning chronotypes if the duration of night‐shift work increased.

  {"id":"pittendrigh1991","abstract":"This paper develops several propositions concerning the lability of the amplitude of Drosophila circadian pacemakers. The first is that the amplitude of the pacemaker's motion, unlike its period, is markedly temperature-dependent. The second is that latitudinal variation in pacemaker amplitude (higher in the north) is responsible for two very different sets of observations on Drosophila circadian systems at successively higher latitudes. One of these is a cline in D. auraria's phase-shifting response to light, which steadily weakens in a succession of more northerly strains. The other, concerning D. littoralis in the very far north, is a cline in the rate at which eclosion activity becomes arrhythmic (the circadian rhythm damps out) in constant darkness; damping is faster in the north.\n            The third proposition concerns a plausible selection pressure for the cline in pacemaker amplitude that we propose underlies the two directly observed clines. Two points are emphasized: (1) The amplitude of the pacemaker's daily oscillation declines as the duration of the entraining light pulse (photoperiod) is increased; and (2) the duration of the daily photoperiods throughout the breeding season is steadily increased as one moves toward the poles. Selection for conservation of pacemaker amplitude (during the breeding season) would produce the latitudinal cline we propose. The fourth, and final proposition is that since the amplitude of the pacemaker's daily motion responds systematically to change in photoperiod, amplitude is clearly one way—and a temperature-dependent way—in which insect circadian systems may sense seasonal change.\n            These propositions concerning the temperature and latitude dependence of pacemaker amplitude may be relevant to a wider array of circadian pacemakers than Drosophila.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pittendrigh","given":"Colin S."},{"family":"Kyner","given":"Walter T."},{"family":"Takamura","given":"Tsuguhiko"}],"citation-key":"pittendrigh1991","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","container-title-short":"J Biol Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/074873049100600402","ISSN":"0748-7304, 1552-4531","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,12]]},"language":"en","page":"299-313","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The amplitude of circadian oscillations: temperature dependence, latitudinal clines, and the photoperiodic time measurement","title-short":"The Amplitude of Circadian Oscillations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/074873049100600402","volume":"6"},

The “environment hypothesis” suggests that M/E is dependent on environmental factors, such as latitude, mean average temperature and photoperiod. We here analyzed a large number of datasets to assess this effect based on a systematic review. Data were from a total of 87 datasets and 35,589 individuals based on 28 countries. Partial correlations correcting for age revealed significant relationships between M/E and latitude, mean yearly temperature, photoperiod and sunset. Evening orientation was related to higher latitude, longer days and later sunset. Morning orientation was related to higher average temperatures. Percentage of females and sunrise time had no significant influence. These variables (sunset, temperature, photoperiod) were then input in a general linear model. The full model showed an influence of age and of sunset on CSM scores, but not of photoperiod and average temperature. Sunset, therefore, seems to be the most important statistical predictor for the observed latitudinal gradient.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Randler","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Rahafar","given":"Arash"}],"citation-key":"randler2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep39976","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,3]]},"language":"en","page":"39976","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Latitude affects morningness-eveningness: evidence for the environment hypothesis based on a systematic review","title-short":"Latitude affects Morningness-Eveningness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39976","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"reis2020","abstract":"Sleep represents an essential element for health and well-being, including cognitive performance, physiological processes, emotional regulation, physical development, and quality of life and is the best observed circadian rhythm in humans. Humans show large differences in the preferred timing of their sleep and activity, so-called chronotypes. Ranging from extreme early types to extreme late chronotypes, the majority falls between these extremes. While chronotype and sleep necessity appear to be independent characteristics, the difference in sleep duration between workdays and work-free days is nonetheless chronotype-dependent because of our social schedules. Extremely earlier chronotype experience shorter sleep duration on free-days and longer on workdays. On the other hand, the later chronotypes have shorter sleep duration on workdays and longer on free days. Its described in literature that chronotypes become later from eastern to western border of time zones. The social time is equal, whereas solar time is progressively delayed, producing a later phase of entrainment and increased discrepancies between individuals' social and biological circadian times, that can lead to a higher circadian disruption with potential health detriments. Portugal is in Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT) time zone, the second most western and the most southern country, so it is expected that the Portuguese might be especially late chronotypes. Therefore, to explore their sleep/chronotype is of major interest.\nThe studies present in this thesis aimed to characterize the sleep/wake phases of the Portuguese general population as well as in sleep medicine patients and to compare them with other countries/samples. The characterization of a clinical sample of extreme late chronotypes and to evaluate how much the social clocks influence the sleep quality in sleep disorder patients were also objectives of this thesis. In order to accomplish these objectives five different studies were performed:\nStudy 1) Aiming to evaluate self-reported average sleep duration (n= 5,436 adults; EpiDoC3 cohort) and its possible associations with demographic features and chronic medical disorders. Cross-sectional, populational based study. The prevalence for Short Sleep Duration (SSD) was high (20.7%) and for Long Sleep Duration (LSD) (5.9%) was relatively low. Being older, with lower education, retired and unemployed were associated to SSD and LSD (p<0.01). Being obese was associated to SSD as well as hypertension, gastrointestinal disease and hypercholesterolemia (p<0.01). SSD and LSD, were associated with diabetes (p<0.01 and p=0.03, respectively) and with depression (p<0.01 and p=0.02, respectively). Cardiovascular disease (p<0.01) was associated to LSD. Multimorbidity was associated to SSD (p<0.01). Worse quality of life and bad physical function were associated to SSD and LSD, as well as being hospitalized in the previous 12 months (p<0.01).\nStudy 2) Aimed at understanding if the reported “usual” sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) reflects workdays sleep of sleep disorder patients and to find a social influence on sleep quality detriment of these patients. Cross-sectional, case- control study. 431 sleep disorder patients and 338 subjects from the general population answered three variants of the PSQI (usual (u), work (w), work-free (f) days) and the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). PSQI scores differed between groups (p<0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between PSQIu vs. PSQIf and PSQIw vs. PSQIf with PSQIf presenting lower scores, while PSQIu vs. PSQIw did not differ in any group. In line with previous findings, Social Jetlag (SJL) was associated to PSQIdiff in sleep disorder patients.\nStudy 3) Aimed at validating the Portuguese variant of the MCTQ. Cross-sectional observational study, including the, 80 Portuguese individuals from the general population with 4 weeks of actimetry and MCTQ; The median mid-point of sleep, chronotype (MSFsc) was 4:33 (abs range: 2:04 – 8:45). The 1st quartile was earlier than 3:43, and the 4th quartile later than 5:15. Extreme chronotypes (2.5% at each end of the distribution) were earlier than 2:20 and later than 8:36. Comparing the average chronotype of Portuguese subjects with other countries, the Korean’s were the latest (MSFsc = 5:07) followed by the Portuguese (MSFsc = 4:37), the German (MSFsc = 4:22) and the Japanese (MSFsc = 4:18). For the extreme late chronotypes the Portuguese (8:36) was later than the late 2.5% in the Korean sample (8:34). High correlations between MCTQPT and actimetry derived data were found showing that the MCTQ was a reliable questionnaire to access sleep timings and phase of entrainment for the Portuguese adult population.\nStudy 4) Aimed at characterizing a clinical population of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) patients. In 5 years of registries 245 patients with DSWPD were identified and 162 patients had performed at least one objective sleep/wake/phase measure (actimetry, DLMO, PSG). Gender differences for the different age groups (p=0.028) were observed. Men were more likely to be single and women more likely to be married (p=0.034). In students, school failure was higher for women (p<0.001); for workers, absenteeism was higher in women (p=0.001). In the circadian aligned (compared to misaligned group), DLMO was later (p<0.001), sleep onset time (p=0.046) was later, total sleep time (p=0.035), and number of sleep cycles (p=0.018) were lower, as measured using PSG T1.\nStudy 5) Aimed at comparing 9 European countries in relation to chronotype, average sleep duration and social jetlag. Cross-sectional observational study. 164,234 individuals from the MCTQ-database (8 countries) and a sample of Icelanders (total n=165,378).  The average chronotype among the studied countries ranged between 3.97 ± 1.16 for Belgium and 5.15 ± 0.25 for Spain, for the Central European Greenwich Meridian Time zone (GMT+1) and between 4.21 ± 1.41 for the United Kingdom and 4.76 ± 1.46 for Portugal among the GMT countries. The average Sleep Duration ranged between 7.36 ± 0.21 for Spain and 7.67 ± 0.95 for Belgium, for the GMT+1 and between 7.33 ± 1.05 for Ireland and 8.12 ± 2.42 for Portugal, among the GMT countries. The average SJL ranged between 1.32 ± 0.92 for Netherland and 1.65 ± 0.16, for Spain for the GMT+1 and between 1.24 ± 0.93 for United Kingdom and 1.70 ± 0.86 for Iceland among the GMT countries.\nIn conclusion, the work in this dissertation showed the associations to self-reported total sleep time and chronic diseases and poor health quality to the Portuguese population. A negative social influence on reported sleep quality of Portuguese sleep disorder patients was present. Social jetlag was a predictor for poor sleep quality, mediated by chronotype. We suggest that treatment strategies addressing social aspects affecting sleep quality on workdays and minimizing actions for circadian strain would be of major importance on sleep medicine clinical practice. Late type seems to be common among the Portuguese and this was shown not only for subjective data as well as by objective data.\nRecommendations is something that needs to be considered in our society since it can cause a circadian misalignment, when leaving against our biological clocks.\nThe causes of circadian misalignment and health detriments were well shown in this thesis and have an economic impact measured by the absenteeism and hospitalizations of the EpiReuma study, which should more precisely evaluated in future studies. Sleep education and awareness campaigns are needed for Portugal (general population, physicians, employers and policy makers) in order to advertise to this lateness predisposition, find countermeasures strategies and advertise for health consequences of leaving against the clock.","archive":"Repositório da Universidade de Lisboa","author":[{"family":"Reis","given":"Cátia"}],"citation-key":"reis2020","event-place":"Lisboa","genre":"Tese de doutorado","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"pt","number-of-pages":"268","publisher":"Universidade de Lisboa","publisher-place":"Lisboa","title":"Sleep patterns in portugal","type":"thesis","URL":"http://hdl.handle.net/10451/54147"},
  {"id":"roenneberg2003","abstract":"Human behavior shows large interindividual variation in temporal organization. Extreme “larks” wake up when extreme “owls” fall asleep. These chronotypes are attributed to differences in the circadian clock, and in animals, the genetic basis of similar phenotypic differences is well established. To better understand the genetic basis of temporal organization in humans, the authors developed a questionnaire to document individual sleep times, self-reported light exposure, and self-assessed chronotype, considering work and free days separately. This report summarizes the results of 500 questionnaires completed in a pilot study. Individual sleep times show large differences between work and free days, except for extreme early types. During the workweek, late chronotypes accumulate considerable sleep debt, for which they compensate on free days by lengthening their sleep by several hours. For all chronotypes, the amount of time spent outdoors in broad daylight significantly affects the timing of sleep: Increased self-reported light exposure advances sleep. The timing of self-selected sleep is multifactorial, including genetic disposition, sleep debt accumulated on workdays, and light exposure. Thus, accurate assessment of genetic chronotypes has to incorporate all of these parameters. The dependence of human chronotype on light, that is, on the amplitude of the light:dark signal, follows the known characteristics of circadian systems in all other experimental organisms. Our results predict that the timing of sleep has changed during industrialization and that a majority of humans are sleep deprived during the workweek. The implications are far ranging concerning learning, memory, vigilance, performance, and quality of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Roenneberg","given":"Till"},{"family":"Wirz-Justice","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Merrow","given":"Martha"}],"citation-key":"roenneberg2003","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","container-title-short":"J Biol Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/0748730402239679","ISSN":"0748-7304, 1552-4531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,2]]},"language":"en","page":"80-90","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Life between clocks: daily temporal patterns of human chronotypes","title-short":"Life between Clocks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730402239679","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"roenneberg2010","abstract":"The traditional approaches to predict entrainment of circadian clocks by light are based on 2 concepts that were never successfully unified: the non-parametric approach assumes that entrainment occurs via discrete daily phase shifts while the parametric approach assumes that entrainment involves changes of the clock’s velocity. Here the authors suggest a new approach to predict and model entrainment. Unlike the traditional approaches, it does not assume a priori the mechanism of how the internal and external cycle lengths are matched (via phase shifts, velocity changes, or even other mechanisms). It is based on a circadian integrated response characteristic (CIRC) that describes how the circadian system integrates light signals at different circadian phases, without specifying exactly when and how fast its progression is affected. Light around subjective dawn compresses the internal cycle; light around subjective dusk expands it. While the phase response curve (PRC) describes the results of experiments using light stimuli (of specified duration and intensity), the CIRC reflects how the system integrates any given light profile, be it single pulses or any form of light-dark cycle (from skeleton photoperiods to natural light profiles). CIRCs are characterized by their shape (determining the extent of their dead zone) and their asymmetry (the ratio of its compressing and expanding portions). They are dimensionless (time/time), and their maximum is by definition 1. To make predictions about entrainment, the CIRC is multiplied with the light intensity/sensitivity at any given time point. Unlike the PRC and the velocity response curve, the CIRC can be assessed on the basis of entrained steady states, by modeling experimental results. The CIRC approach makes several predictions that can be tested experimentally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Roenneberg","given":"Till"},{"family":"Hut","given":"Roelof"},{"family":"Daan","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Merrow","given":"Martha"}],"citation-key":"roenneberg2010","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","container-title-short":"J Biol Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/0748730410379082","ISSN":"0748-7304, 1552-4531","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"language":"en","page":"329-339","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Entrainment concepts revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730410379082","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"roh2012","abstract":"Decreased sleep and attenuation of circadian fluctuations in Aβ reflect amyloid-associated pathology in Alzheimer’s disease.\n          , \n            Don’t Let Amyloid Keep You Awake at Night\n            The accumulation in the brain of the neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide is a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ accumulation in amyloid plaques begins about 10 to 15 years before cognitive decline and is already very substantial by the time memory and thinking problems begin. It is critical to determine whether there are functional and biochemical changes in the brain that are present when Aβ is accumulating but before the appearance of dementia to initiate therapy earlier as well as to assess the therapeutic effects of new drugs. Previous work has shown that soluble forms of Aβ fluctuate in the brain with the sleep-wake cycle. Now, Roh and colleagues show that diurnal fluctuation of Aβ occurs in different brain regions in young adult mice that develop accumulation of Aβ. However, Aβ fluctuation disappeared with the onset of amyloid plaque deposition, most likely due to insoluble Aβ plaques sequestering soluble forms of Aβ. Similar findings were seen in the cerebrospinal fluid of humans with genetic mutations that cause early-onset, autosomal dominant AD. Coincident with increasing Aβ accumulation, the researchers found that the amount of time mice were awake when they were supposed to be asleep increased by 50%. Actively immunizing mice with Aβ prevented amyloid plaque formation, as well as maintaining normal circadian Aβ fluctuation and normal sleep patterns. These findings suggest that changes in the sleep-wake cycle may be caused by Aβ accumulation. If analogous abnormalities in the sleep-wake cycle are present in cognitively normal and very mildly impaired humans who are developing AD pathology, the sleep-wake cycle may be a useful indicator of early brain dysfunction that could be assessed as an outcome measure in response to therapeutic interventions.\n          , \n            \n              Aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain begins to occur years before the clinical onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Before Aβ aggregation, concentrations of extracellular soluble Aβ in the interstitial fluid (ISF) space of the brain, which are regulated by neuronal activity and the sleep-wake cycle, correlate with the amount of Aβ deposition in the brain seen later. The amount and quality of sleep decline with normal aging and to a greater extent in AD patients. How sleep quality as well as the diurnal fluctuation in Aβ change with age and Aβ aggregation is not well understood. We report a normal sleep-wake cycle and diurnal fluctuation in ISF Aβ in the brain of the APPswe/PS1δE9 mouse model of AD before Aβ plaque formation. After plaque formation, the sleep-wake cycle markedly deteriorated and diurnal fluctuation of ISF Aβ dissipated. As in mice, diurnal fluctuation of cerebrospinal fluid Aβ in young adult humans with presenilin mutations was also markedly attenuated after Aβ plaque formation. Virtual elimination of Aβ deposits in the mouse brain by active immunization with Aβ\n              42\n              normalized the sleep-wake cycle and the diurnal fluctuation of ISF Aβ. These data suggest that Aβ aggregation disrupts the sleep-wake cycle and diurnal fluctuation of Aβ. Sleep-wake behavior and diurnal fluctuation of Aβ in the central nervous system may be functional and biochemical indicators, respectively, of Aβ-associated pathology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Roh","given":"Jee Hoon"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yafei"},{"family":"Bero","given":"Adam W."},{"family":"Kasten","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Floy R."},{"family":"Bateman","given":"Randall J."},{"family":"Holtzman","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"roh2012","container-title":"Science Translational Medicine","container-title-short":"Sci.

  {"id":"wang2020","abstract":"Text similarity measurement is the basis of natural language processing tasks, which play an important role in information retrieval, automatic question answering, machine translation, dialogue systems, and document matching. This paper systematically combs the research status of similarity measurement, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of current methods, develops a more comprehensive classification description system of text similarity measurement algorithms, and summarizes the future development direction. With the aim of providing reference for related research and application, the text similarity measurement method is described by two aspects: text distance and text representation. The text distance can be divided into length distance, distribution distance, and semantic distance; text representation is divided into string-based, corpus-based, single-semantic text, multi-semantic text, and graph-structure-based representation. Finally, the development of text similarity is also summarized in the discussion section.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiapeng"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Yihong"}],"citation-key":"wang2020","container-title":"Information","container-title-short":"Information","DOI":"10.3390/info11090421","ISSN":"2078-2489","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"421","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Measurement of text similarity: a survey","title-short":"Measurement of Text Similarity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/9/421","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"wilkinson2016","abstract":"Abstract\n            There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Dumontier","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Aalbersberg","given":"IJsbrand Jan"},{"family":"Appleton","given":"Gabrielle"},{"family":"Axton","given":"Myles"},{"family":"Baak","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Blomberg","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"Boiten","given":"Jan-Willem"},{"family":"Da Silva Santos","given":"Luiz Bonino"},{"family":"Bourne","given":"Philip E."},{"family":"Bouwman","given":"Jildau"},{"family":"Brookes","given":"Anthony J."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Crosas","given":"Mercè"},{"family":"Dillo","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Dumon","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Edmunds","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Evelo","given":"Chris T."},{"family":"Finkers","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Gonzalez-Beltran","given":"Alejandra"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Alasdair J.G."},{"family":"Groth","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Goble","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Grethe","given":"Jeffrey S."},{"family":"Heringa","given":"Jaap"},{"family":"’T Hoen","given":"Peter A.C"},{"family":"Hooft","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Kok","given":"Ruben"},{"family":"Kok","given":"Joost"},{"family":"Lusher","given":"Scott J."},{"family":"Martone","given":"Maryann E."},{"family":"Mons","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Packer","given":"Abel L."},{"family":"Persson","given":"Bengt"},{"family":"Rocca-Serra","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Roos","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Van Schaik","given":"Rene"},{"family":"Sansone","given":"Susanna-Assunta"},{"family":"Schultes","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Sengstag","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Slater","given":"Ted"},{"family":"Strawn","given":"George"},{"family":"Swertz","given":"Morris A."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Van Der Lei","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Van Mulligen","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Velterop","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Waagmeester","given":"Andra"},{"family":"Wittenburg","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Wolstencroft","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Mons","given":"Barend"}],"citation-key":"wilkinson2016","container-title":"Scientific Data","container-title-short":"Sci Data","DOI":"10.1038/sdata.2016.18","ISSN":"2052-4463","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"160018","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618","volume":"3"}
