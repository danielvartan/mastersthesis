How are the sleep-wake cycles and circadian phenotypes of the adult Brazilian population characterized?\n\nQ2. Is latitude associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms in humans?\n\n\nThe primary objectives (PO) are as follows:\n\n\nPO1. Quantitatively describe the expression of sleep-wake cycles and circadian phenotypes of the Brazilian adult population at the end of the year 2017 (pre-pandemic).\n\nPO2. Investigate and model the presence/absence of a significant association and effect between decimal degrees of latitude (independent variable (IV)) and circadian phenotypes (dependent variable (DV)) of the Brazilian population."

The absence of a strong entrainment with the solar zeitgeber shows that the entrainment phenomenon is more complex than we previously imagined. Other hypotheses for the human circadian entrainment, like the entrainment to self-selected light, proposed by Anna Skeldon and Derk-Jan Dijk (2021), need to be tested and may produce significant results."
