Thus, latitude was considered significant only if its inclusion accounted for at least \\(1.960784\\%\\) of the variance in chronotype.\nTo balance the sample, a weighting procedure was applied to the data.

Assumption checking and residual diagnostics primarily relied on visual inspection, as formal assumption tests (e.g., Anderson-Darling) are often not recommended for large samples (Shatz, 2024). All validity assumptions were met, and no serious multicollinearity was found among the predictor variables.\nAn ANOVA for nested models revealed a significant reduction in the residual sum of squares in both tests (A \\(\\text{F}(4, 65814) = 51.71\\), \\(p\\text{-value} &lt; 1e-05\\)) (B \\(\\text{F}(1, 65817) = 37.325\\), \\(p\\text{-value} &lt; 1e-05\\)).\n\nHowever, similarly to Leocadio-Miguel et al.
