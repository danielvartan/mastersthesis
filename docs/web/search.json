[Master’s Thesis, University of São Paulo].\n\nTheories on circadian rhythms are well-established in science, but there is still a need to test them in larger samples to gain a better understanding of the expression of temporal phenotypes. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that latitude influences chronotype expression, based on the idea that regions closer to the poles receive less sunlight over the year than equatorial regions. This difference suggests that equatorial areas have a stronger solar zeitgeber, which could lead to greater synchronization of circadian rhythms with the light-dark cycle, reducing the amplitude and diversity of circadian phenotypes, resulting in a higher propensity for morningness in those populations. To test this hypothesis, data from \\(120,265\\) individuals from all regions of Brazil were analyzed, collected in 2017 based on the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), a validated questionnaire to assess circadian phenotypes derived from individuals’ sleep-wake cycles over the past four weeks. The analysis, using nested linear regression models, revealed a negligible effect of latitude on the variation in chronotype expression (Cohen’s \\(f^2\\): \\(0.00740\\)), contrasting with recent studies. Although the hypothesis is reasonable and aligns with evolutionary theories of temporal biological systems, the results suggest that the phenomenon of entrainment is more complex than previously thought. \nKeywords: Complexity science.

    "text": "You are reading the work-in-progress of this thesis.\nThis chapter should be readable but is currently undergoing final polishing.\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a long-standing debate in the chronobiology community regarding the relationship between latitude and circadian phenotypes (chronotypes) (Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2017; Randler, 2008; Skeldon & Dijk, 2021; Zerbini et al., 2021), with many believing this association is already well-established. This hypothesis stems from the varying amounts of solar radiation experienced by populations across different latitudes. Since light exposure is a primary zeitgeber —a periodic environmental cue that influences or regulates biological rhythms— such variations are thought to create noticeable differences in chronotype distributions globally. This thesis investigates the so-called latitude or environmental hypothesis, addressing the question: Is latitude associated with chronotype?.\nThe central hypothesis is that latitude is associated with chronotype distributions, with populations closer to the equator exhibiting, on average, a shorter or more morning-oriented circadian phenotype compared to those residing near the poles (Hut et al., 2013; Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2014, 2017; Pittendrigh et al., 1991; Randler, 2008; Randler & Rahafar, 2017; Roenneberg et al., 2003). The primary objective is to model and test this hypothesis by critically examining whether a significant association and effect size exist between latitude and circadian phenotypes in the Brazilian population.\nIn the following chapters, the latitude hypothesis is explored using Popper’s hypothetical-deductive method (Popper, 1979) and an improved approach to Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), rooted in the original Neyman-Pearson framework for data testing (Neyman & Pearson, 1928a, 1928b; Perezgonzalez, 2015). This exploration involves a series of analyses conducted on a large dataset comprising \\(120,265\\) individuals, collected from the Brazilian population in 2017. The dataset is based on the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) (Roenneberg et al., 2003, 2012), and contains information on sleep habits and demographic characteristics from various regions of Brazil.\nThe analyses utilize nested multiple regression models to evaluate the additional variance explained and the effect size when latitude is included as a predictor of chronotype. The results are then compared with those obtained from a restricted model that excludes latitude as a predictor. This method of prodecure builds on an article published by Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017), which investigated the relationship between latitude and chronotype in the Brazilian population. The present study extends this work by utilizing a larger dataset and more advanced statistical methods to test the hypothesis. The results will contribute to the ongoing debate on the latitude-chronotype relationship, offering new evidences into how environmental factors influence human circadian rhythms.\nThis procedure method is related to an article published in 2017 by Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017), which investigated the relationship between latitude and chronotype in the Brazilian population. The present study extends this work by using a larger dataset and more sophisticated statistical methods to test the hypothesis. The results of this investigation will contribute to the ongoing debate on the relationship between latitude and chronotype, providing valuable insights into the role of environmental factors in shaping human circadian rhythms.\nThe thesis is structure as a collection of articles. Chapters 2 through 4 comprise a series of essays and literature reviews related to the thesis topic. Chapter 5 presents the main investigation, including an article reporting the hypothesis test and discussing the central research question. Finally, Chapter 6 offers conclusions and directions for future research.\nAll the analyses in this document are reproducible and were conducted using the R programming language along with the Quarto publishing system.\n\n\n\n\n\nHut, R.

    "text": "You are reading the work-in-progress of this thesis.\nThis chapter is currently a dumping ground for ideas, and I don’t recommend reading it.\n\n\n\nAlthough many theories related to sleep and circadian rhythms are well-established in science, it is still necessary to verify and test them in larger samples to obtain a more accurate picture of the mechanisms related to the ecology of sleep and chronotypes. This project undertakes this commitment with the aim of investigating a hypothesis that is still relatively untested but widely accepted in chronobiology, which suggests that latitude is associated with the regulation of circadian rhythms (Hut et al., 2013; Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2014, 2017; Pittendrigh et al., 1991; Randler, 2008; Randler & Rahafar, 2017; Roenneberg et al., 2003).\nThe latitude hypothesis is based on the idea that regions located at latitudes close to the poles, on average, experience less annual sunlight exposure compared to regions near the equator. Therefore, it is deduced that regions near latitude 0° have a stronger solar zeitgeber, which, according to chronobiology theories, should lead to a greater propensity for the synchronization of circadian rhythms in these populations with the light-dark cycle. This would reduce the amplitude and diversity of circadian phenotypes found due to a lower influence of individuals’ characteristic endogenous periods (Figure 4.1 illustrates this effect). This would also give these populations a morningness characteristic when compared to populations living farther from the equator, where the opposite would occur – greater amplitude and diversity of circadian phenotypes and an eveningness characteristic compared to populations living near latitude 0° (Roenneberg et al., 2003).\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Different chronotype distributions, influenced by strong and weak zeitgebers – black for strong and hatched for weak. An illustration of the effect hypothesized by the latitude hypothesis.\n\n\nSource: Adapted from Roenneberg et al. (2003).\n\n\n\n“However, it is also our experience that some mathematically sophisticated scientists may lack the conceptual frame that links the mathematical procedures to the substantive scientific task in a particular case” (Cohen et al., 2002).\nEffect sizes. Statistical ritual versus statistical thinking (Gigerenzer, 2004).\nA p-value is not evidence of the existence of an effect., it’s only indirect evidence at best. Large samples and the p-value problem (Lin et al., 2013). P-values as an exponential model of data sizes (Gómez-de-Mariscal et al., 2021). A small p-value does not imply that there is an important effect; it only tells us something about the plausibility of the effect. You need to have a meaningful effect to have an interesting result, and the p-value doesn’t tell you that.\nConfidence intervals for an effect size measure in multiple linear regression (Algina et al., 2007). Setting hypotheses with effect sizes: minimal effect size (Perezgonzalez, 2015).\nThe original article had two issues regarding data testing, commonly related to null hypothesis significance tests (NHST). It is not within the scope of this article to discuss all the issues regarding NHST; for that, I recommend checking Perezgonzalez (2015). The two main methodological issues regarding the hypothesis test in the original article were:\n\nUsing the p-value instead of the effect size as a criterion for rejecting or accepting the alternative hypothesis;\nFailing to integrate a minimum effect size in the alternative hypothesis. A test without the latter can create serious distortions in the interpretation of the results, since even a negligible effect could lead to the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nConsidering the particular emphasis that the solar zeitgeber has on the entrainment of biological rhythms (as demonstrated in many experiments), it would not be reasonable to assume that the latitude hypothesis could be supported without at least a non-negligible effect size. Although the latitude association claimed by many authors implies not just a linear relationship but also a significant effect on chronotype, considering the biological construct of chronotype, the approach that incorporates a minimum effect size (MES) is not new. In fact, when Neyman and Pearson published their schema for data testing, a MES was required.\nEven assuming a very low threshold, similar to the claim of 2% variance explained by latitude as a predictor, the hypothesis does not hold. As shown by Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017), adding \\(0.00388\\) to the \\(\\text{R}^2\\) results in Cohen’s \\(f^2 = (0.06352 - 0.05964) / (1 - 0.06352) = 0.004143174\\), which is negligible by all standards. Again, the conclusion drawn by the authors of this study was not based on sound statistical thinking.\ny-axis illusion. unbalanced data.\n\n\n\n\nAlgina, J., Keselman, H. J., & Penfield, R. D.

    "text": "5.1.1 Introduction\nHumans can differ from one another in many ways. These observable traits, like hair color or height, are called phenotypes and are also presented in the way that our body functions.\nA chronotype is a temporal phenotype (Ehret, 1974; Pittendrigh, 1993). This word is usually used to refer to endogenous circadian rhythms, i.e., rhythms which periods that are close to a day or 24 hours (circa diem). The current body of knowledge of Chronobiology, the science that studies biological rhythms, indicates that the evolution of these internal oscillators is linked to our oscillatory environment, like the day and night cycle, which, along with our evolution, created environmental pressures for the development of a temporal organization (Aschoff, 1989; Paranjpe & Sharma, 2005). A way in which an organism could predict events and better manage its needs, like storing food for the winter.\nA temporal system wouldn’t be of much use if it could not follow environmental changes. To those environmental signals that can regulate the biological rhythms are given the name zeitgeber (from the German Zeit, time, and Geber, giver). These zeitgebers produce inputs in our bodies that can shift and align those rhythms. This phenomenon is called entrainment (Roenneberg, Daan, et al., 2003; Roenneberg et al., 2010).\nThe main zeitgeber known today is the light, particularly the sun’s light (Khalsa et al., 2003; Minors et al., 1991; Roenneberg et al., 2007). Considering its influence in entraining the biological temporal system, several studies hypothesize that the latitudinal shift of the sun, related to the earth’s axis, would produce, on average, different temporal traits in populations that live close to the equator line when compared to populations that live close to the planet’s poles (Horzum et al., 2015; Hut et al., 2013; Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2014, 2017; Pittendrigh et al., 1991; Randler & Rahafar, 2017). That is because the latter ones would have greater oscillations in sun activity and an overall weak solar zeitgeber. This is the latitude hypothesis, that can also appear as the environmental hypothesis of circadian rhythm regulation.\nRecently there have been attempts to test the latitude hypothesis in different settings, but, at least in humans, none of them have been successful in seeing a significant effect size related to the latitudinal cline. Some of these approaches worked with secondary data and with small samples. One of the most serious attempts of testing this hypothesis was made by Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017). They measured the chronotype of \\(12,884\\) Brazillian subjects on a wide latitudinal spectrum using the Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Their results showed a negligible effect size. One possible reason for this is that the MEQ measures psychological traits and not biological states (Roenneberg, Pilz, et al., 2019), i.e., the circadian oscillation itself, therefore, it’s not the best way to answer the question (Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2014).\nThis article brings a novel attempt to test the latitude hypothesis, using, this time, a biological approach provided by the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) (Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, et al., 2003). Furthermore, the test was carried out on the biggest chronotype sample ever collected in a same country. A sample made of \\(76,744\\) subjects, all living in the same timezone in Brazil, with only one week of difference between questionnaire responses.\n\n5.1.2 Results\nThe local time of the sleep corrected midpoint between sleep onset and sleep end on work-free days (MSFsc), MCTQ proxy for measuring the chronotype, had an overall mean of \\(\\text{04:28:35}\\). The distribution curve is shown in Figure 5.1.\nThat’s the midsleep point of Brazilian subjects with an intermediate/average chronotype. One can imagine, following the 7-9h sleep recommendation for healthy adults of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) (Watson et al., 2015), that this average person would, if he/she had no social obligations, typically wake up at about \\(\\text{08:28:35}\\).\n\nCodesource(here::here(\"R/utils.R\"))\n\nutc_minus_3_states &lt;- c(\n  \"Amapá\", \"Pará\", \"Maranhão\", \"Tocantins\", \"Piauí\", \"Ceará\",\n  \"Rio Grande do Norte\", \"Paraíba\", \"Pernambuco\", \"Alagoas\", \"Sergipe\",\n  \"Bahia\", \"Distrito Federal\", \"Goiás\", \"Minas Gerais\", \"Espírito Santo\",\n  \"Rio de Janeiro\", \"São Paulo\", \"Paraná\", \"Santa Catarina\",\n  \"Rio Grande do Sul\"\n)\n\n# data &lt;- targets::tar_make(script = \"../_targets.R\")\n\ndata &lt;- \n  targets::tar_read(\"geocoded_data\", store = here::here(\"_targets\")) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(state %in% utc_minus_3_states) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(msf_sc, age, sex, state, latitude, longitude) |&gt;\n  tidyr::drop_na(msf_sc, age, sex, latitude)\n\n\nCodesource(here::here(\"R/plot_chronotype.R\"))\n\ndata |&gt; \n  plot_chronotype(\n    col = \"msf_sc\", \n    x_lab = \"Frequency (%)\",\n    y_lab = latex2exp::TeX(\"Local time ($MSF_{sc}$)\"),\n    col_width = 0.8,\n    col_border = 0.6,\n    text_size = env_vars$base_size,\n    chronotype_cuts = FALSE,\n    legend_position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Distribution of the local time of the sleep corrected midpoint between sleep onset and sleep end on work-free days (MSFsc), MCTQ proxy for measuring the chronotype. The categorical cut-offs follow a quantile approach going from extremely early (\\(0 |- 0.11\\)) to the extremely late (\\(0.88 - 1\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Created by the author. Based on data visualization found in Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, et al. (2019).\n\n\n\nThe MSFsc curve had a skewness of \\(0.284\\) and a kurtosis of \\(2.773\\). However, the distribution was not normal accordingly to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (\\(\\text{D} = 0.03717\\); \\(\\text{p-value} = 2e-16\\)) and D’Agostino Skewness test (\\(\\text{Z3} = 31.525\\); \\(\\text{p-value} = 2.2e-16\\)) (see D’Agostino & Belanger, 1990; also Thode, 2002, p. 46, p. 101).\nA linear regression model was created with MSFsc as the response variable and with age and sex as predictors (\\(\\text{R}^{2} = 0.05373\\); \\(\\text{F}(2, 76741) = 2180\\), \\(\\text{p-value} = 2e-16\\)), the two most known predictors for chronotype (Roenneberg et al. (2007)). A Box-Cox transformation of the response variable was needed to attend to the linear regression model assumptions (\\(\\lambda = -1.1111\\); \\(\\text{MSF}_{\\text{sc}}^{\\lambda - 1} / \\lambda\\)). All coefficients were significantly different than \\(0\\) (\\(\\text{p-value} = 2e-16\\)) and, accordingly to D’Agostino Skewness test, the residuals were normal (\\(\\text{Z3} = -1.1906\\); \\(\\text{p-value} = 0.23383\\)). Residual homoscedasticity was verified by a Score Test for Heteroskedasticity (\\(\\chi^{2} = 0.00\\); \\(\\text{p-value} = 1\\)). No collinearity was found between the predictor variables (variance inflation factor: \\(\\text{age} = 1.0012\\); \\(\\text{sex} = 1.0012\\)).\nAnother model was created on top of the first one, adding the latitude as a predictor variable (\\(\\text{R}^{2} = 0.060698\\); \\(\\text{F}(3, 76740) = 1650\\), \\(\\text{p-value} = 2e-16\\)). All coefficients were significantly different than 0 (\\(\\text{p-value} = 2e-16\\)) and the residuals were normally distributed accordingly to the D’Agostino Skewness test, (\\(\\text{Z3} = 0.0742\\); \\(\\text{p-value} = 0.94085\\)). Residual homoscedasticity was verified by a Score Test for Heteroskedasticity (\\(\\chi^{2} = 0.00\\); \\(\\text{p-value} = 1\\)). No collinearity was found between the predictor variables (variance inflation factor: \\(\\text{age} = 1.0065\\); \\(\\text{sex} = 1.0016\\); \\(\\text{latitude} = 1.0056\\)). The longitude was not used as a predictor because it presented colinearity with the latitude variable.\nAn \\(\\text{F}\\) test for nested models showed a significant reduction of the residual sum of squares (\\(\\text{F}(1, 76740) = 568.94\\), \\(\\text{p-value} = 2e-16\\)), meaning that the latitude seems to produce an effect on the chronotype. However, when estimating Cohen’s \\(f^2\\) effect size, the result was negligible (Cohen, 1992) \\(((0.06069 - 0.05373) / (1 - 0.06069) = 0.00740\\)).\n\n5.1.3 Discussion\nIt’s important to note that a causal and linear relationship between latitude and chronotype is an a priori assumption. The objective of this study is to test or falsify this hypothesis.\nFor the latitude hypothesis to be true, there must be a significant association between these two variables when the most common covariates are controlled. Predictive models, in this case, are an adequate method for testing this.\nThe results show that even with a wide latitudinal spectrum and with a big and aligned sample of biological states the latitude effect does not reveal itself in a non-negligible size. Several studies indicate the existence of this effect on the chronotype (Hut et al., 2013; Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2017; Pittendrigh et al., 1991; Randler, 2008; Randler & Rahafar, 2017; Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, et al., 2003), but, at this time, at least in humans, no empirical evidence can support this claim. Our results are very similar to Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017), which also found a negligible effect size (Cohen’s \\(f^{2} = 0.004143174\\)). The inconsistency of the latitude effect can be visualized in Figure 5.2.\nCodesource(here::here(\"R/plot_latitude_series.R\"))\n\ndata |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(age &lt;= 50) |&gt;\n  plot_latitude_series(\n    col = \"msf_sc\", \n    y_lab = latex2exp::TeX(\"$MSF_{sc} \\\\pm SEM$\"), \n    line_width = 2, \n    point_size = 3,\n    error_bar_width = 0.5, \n    error_bar_linewidth = 1, \n    error_bar = TRUE,\n    text_size = env_vars$base_size\n  )\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Distribution of mean aggregates of the local time of the sleep corrected midpoint between sleep onset and sleep end on work-free days (MSFsc), MCTQ proxy for measuring the chronotype, in relation to latitude decimal degree intervals.

Based on data visualization found in Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017).\n\n\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, is not uncommon to hear talks insisting that this effect is real and already confirmed. We suspect that this behavior may be derived from a lack of understanding of statistical models and techniques. Although it may be logical and aligned with the overall theory for the evolution of biological temporal systems, it’s our role as scientists to eliminate contractions, not pursue them.\nThe absence of a strong entrainment with the solar zeitgeber shows that the entrainment phenomenon is more complex than we previously imagined. Other hypotheses for the human circadian entrainment, like the entrainment to self-selected light, proposed by Anna Skeldon and Derk-Jan Dijk (2021), need to be tested and may produce significant results. Methods and techiniques for complex systems, like causal loop diagrams and agent-based models (ABM), may help to unravel this phenomenon more properly.\nIt’s important to notice that the results shown here are preliminary. The data still needs some cleaning and to be balanced with Brazil’s latest population census. The latitude coordinates used in the analysis are related to subjects’ residential state capital and, hence, have low resolution. Even with these results, it may be that a significant latitude effect can still appear at the end of the research.\nDespite the several strengths that the dataset used in this study has, it is also important to notice its weaknesses and limitations. The fact that all the subjects were measured in the Spring season is one of them. Since the objective is to catch individuals in different seasonal patterns, the ideal moment to collect this kind of data is in the wintertime, when there is a greater insolation gradient between the equator and the poles. Another one is that this dataset can be influenced by the presence of a Daylight Saving Time (DST) event. This latter issue is explored in more detail in the methods section.",

    "text": "5.2 Methods\n\n5.2.1 Measurement instrument\nChronotypes were measured using the core version of the standard Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) (Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, et al., 2003). MCTQ is a widely validated and widely used self-report questionnaire for measuring the sleep-wake cycle and chronotypes (Roenneberg, Pilz, et al., 2019). It quantifies the chronotype as a state, a biological circadian phenotype, using as a proxy the local time of the sleep corrected midpoint between sleep onset and sleep end on work-free days (MSFsc). A sleep correction (SC) is made when a possible sleep compensation related to a lack of sleep on workdays is identified (Roenneberg, 2012).\nSubjects were asked to complete an online questionnaire based on the MCTQ Portuguese translation created by Till Roenneberg & Martha Merrow for the EUCLOCK project (Roenneberg & Merrow, 2006) (\\(\\text{statements mean cosine distance} = 0.921\\)). They were also asked to provide sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex), geographic (e.g., full residential address), anthropometric (e.g., weight, height), and work/study routine-related data. A deactivated version of the questionnaire can be seen at https://bit.ly/brchrono-form.\n\n5.2.2 Sample\nThe sample is made up of \\(76,744\\) Brazilian subjects. It was obtained in 2017 from October 15th to 21st by a broadcast of the online questionnaire on a popular Sunday TV show with national reach (Rede Globo, 2017). This amount of data collected in such a short time gave the sample a population cross-sectional characteristic.\nA survey conducted in 2019 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) (2021) found that \\(82.17\\%\\) of Brazilian households had access to an internet connection. Therefore, this sample is likely to have a good representation of Brazil’s population. Only residents of Brazilian states in the UTC-3 timezone, aged \\(18\\) years or older, were included in the final sample.\nIn order to verify if the sample size was adequate for the study of the phenomenon under investigation, a power analysis was conducted for nested multiple regression models using the G*Power software (Faul et al., 2007). The analysis used the parameters presented in Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017) article for a multiple linear regression with 10 tested predictors and only \\(10\\) conceived predictors, considering a significance level of \\(0.05\\) (\\(\\alpha\\)) and a power of \\(0.95\\) (\\(1 - \\beta\\)). The result showed that a sample of \\(5,895\\) individuals would be necessary to test the hypothesis.\nDaylight Saving Time (DST) began in Brazil at midnight on October 15th, 2017. Residents from the Midwest, Southeast, and South regions were instructed to set the clock forward by 1 hour. We believe that this event did not contaminate the data since it started on the same day of the data collection. It’s important to notice that MCTQ asks subjects to relate their routine behavior, not how they behaved in the last few days. A possible effect of the DST on the sample is the production of an even later chronotype for populations near the planet’s poles, amplifying a possible latitude effect. However, this was not shown on the hypothesis test.\n\nBased on the 2022 census (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, n.d.-a), Brazil had \\(52.263\\%\\) of females and \\(47.737\\%\\) of males with an age equal to or greater than 18 years old. The sample is skewed for female subjects, with \\(66.297\\%\\) of females and \\(33.703\\%\\) of male subjects.\nThe subjects’ mean age is \\(32.015\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 9.252\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 58.786\\)). Female subjects have a mean age of \\(31.787\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 9.364\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 58.786\\)) and male subjects \\(32.464\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 9.012\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 58.772\\)). For comparison, based on the 2022 census (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, n.d.-b), Brazil’s population with an age equal to or greater than \\(18\\) years old had a mean age of \\(44.277\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 17.221\\)), with a mean age of \\(44.987\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 17.511\\)) for female subjects and a mean age of \\(43.499\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 16.864\\)) for male subjects.\nConsidering the five regions of Brazil, the sample is mostly skewed for the Southeast, the most populated region. According to Brazil’s 2022 census (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2022), the Southeast region is home to \\(41.784\\%\\) of Brazil’s population, followed by the Northeast (\\(26.910\\%\\)), South (\\(14.741\\%\\)), North (\\(8.544\\%\\)), and Midwest (\\(8.021\\%\\)) regions. \\(62.454\\%\\) of the sample is located in the Southeast region, \\(11.797\\%\\) in the Northeast, \\(17.861\\%\\) in the South, \\(1.682\\%\\) in the North, and \\(6.205\\%\\) in the Midwest region. Note that a lack of subjects in the North and Midwest region is justified by the sample timezone inclusion criteria (UTC-3).\nThe sample latitudinal range was \\(30.211\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -30.109\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 0.10177\\)) with a longitudinal span of \\(16.378\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -51.342\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = -34.964\\)). For comparison, Brazil has a latitudinal range of \\(39.024\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -33.752\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 5.2719\\)) and a longitudinal span of \\(39.198\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -34.793\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = -73.991\\)).\nThe results shown in this article are just a preliminary view of the data analysis. The latitudes and longitudes of each subject are represented by the coordinates of his/her state’s capital (a low resolution). The final results will have the latitude and longitude coordinates based on subjects’ postal codes and will also use a balanced dataset following the latest Brazil census.\n\n5.2.3 Data wrangling\nThe data wrangling and analysis followed the data science program proposed by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (Wickham, 2016). All processes were made with the help of the R programming language (R Core Team, n.d.), RStudio IDE (Posit Team, n.d.), and several R packages. The tidyverse and rOpenSci package ecosystem and other R packages adherents of the tidy tools manifesto (Wickham & Bryan, 2023) were prioritized. The MCTQ data was analyzed using the mctq rOpenSci peer-reviewed package (Vartanian, 2023). All processes were made in order to provide result reproducibility and to be in accordance with the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016).\n\n5.2.4 Hypothesis testing\nThe study hypothesis was tested using nested models of multiple linear regressions. The main idea of nested models is to verify the effect of the inclusion of one or more predictors in the model variance explanation (i.e., the \\(\\text{R}^{2}\\)) (Allen, 1997). This can be made by creating a restricted model and then comparing it with a full model. Hence, the hypothesis can be schematized as follows.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{H}_{0}: \\Delta \\ \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2} \\leq \\text{MES} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{F-test is not significant} \\\\\n\\text{H}_{a}: \\Delta \\ \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2} &gt; \\text{MES} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{F-test is significant}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIn order to test a possible latitude association in predicting the chronotype, the full model was the restricted model with the addition of the latitude variable. The restricted model had the local time of the sleep corrected midpoint between sleep onset and sleep end on work-free days (MSFsc) as the response variable, MCTQ proxy for the chronotype, with sex and age as predictors.\nA residual analysis was made to ensure the validity of the models before the hypothesis test. The hypothesis was tested using a \\(0.05\\) (\\(\\alpha\\)) significance level.\nTo favor the alternative hypothesis (\\(\\text{H}_{a}\\)), not only the \\(\\text{R}^{2}\\) of the full model must be significantly larger than the \\(\\text{R}^{2}\\) of the restricted model, but the effect size must be at least considered small. To evaluate the effect size, Cohen’s \\(f^{2}\\) and his categorical parameters for size were used (Cohen, 1992). That means that, in order to favor (\\(\\text{H}_{a}\\)), the effect size must be at least equal to or greater than \\(0.0219\\).\n\n5.2.5 Data availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author [DV].

The basic structure of this approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: Simplified schema of Popper’s hypothetico-deductive method.\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(P1) --&gt; B(TT)\n  B --&gt; C(EE)\n  C --&gt; D(P2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere \\(\\text{P}_1\\), is the problem from which we start, \\(\\text{TT}\\) (the ‘tentative theory’) is the imaginative conjectural solution which we first reach, for example our first tentative interpretation. \\(\\text{EE}\\) (‘error- elimination’) consists of a severe critical examination of our conjecture, our tentative interpretation: it consists, for example, of the critical use of documentary evidence and, if we have at this early stage more than one conjecture at our disposal, it will also consist of a critical discussion and comparative evaluation of the competing conjectures. \\(\\text{P}_2\\) is the problem situation as it emerges from our first critical attempt to solve our problems. It leads up to our second attempt (and so on) (Popper, 1979, p. 164).\n\nThe tentative theory or main hypothesis, as stated in Chapter 1, is the following:\n\nHypothesis\n\nlatitude is associated with chronotype distributions, with populations closer to the equator exhibiting, on average, a shorter or more morning-oriented circadian phenotype compared to those residing near the poles (Hut et al., 2013; Leocadio-Miguel et al., 2014, 2017; Pittendrigh et al., 1991; Randler, 2008; Randler & Rahafar, 2017; Roenneberg et al., 2003).\n\n\nAs a procedure method, an improved approach to Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), rooted in the original Neyman-Pearson framework for data testing is employed (Neyman & Pearson, 1928a, 1928b; Perezgonzalez, 2015).\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{H}_{0}: \\text{Latitude is not associated with chronotype} \\\\\n\\text{H}_{a}: \\text{Latitude is associated with chronotype}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]",

    "text": "A.3 Methods\n\nA.3.1 Measurement instrument\nChronotypes were measured using a an sleep log based on the core version of the standard Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) (Roenneberg et al., 2003). MCTQ is a widely validated and widely used self-report questionnaire for measuring the sleep-wake cycle and chronotypes (Roenneberg et al., 2019). It quantifies the chronotype as a state, a biological circadian phenotype, using as a proxy the local time of the sleep corrected midpoint between sleep onset and sleep end on work-free days (MSFsc). A sleep correction (SC) is made when a possible sleep compensation related to a lack of sleep on workdays is identified (Roenneberg, 2012).\nSubjects were asked to complete an online questionnaire with the sleep log and to provide sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex), geographic (e.g., full residential address), anthropometric (e.g., weight, height), and work/study routine-related data. A deactivated version of the questionnaire can be seen at https://bit.ly/brchrono-form.\n\nA.3.2 Sample\nThe cleaned and validated sample is made up of \\(76,744\\) Brazilian subjects. It was obtained in 2017 from October 15th to 21st by a broadcast of the online questionnaire on a popular Sunday TV show with national reach (Rede Globo, 2017). This amount of data collected in such a short time gave the sample a population cross-sectional characteristic.\nA survey conducted in 2019 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) (2021) found that \\(82.17\\%\\) of Brazilian households had access to an internet connection. Therefore, this sample is likely to have a good representation of Brazil’s population. Only residents of Brazilian states in the UTC-3 timezone, aged \\(18\\) years or older, were included in the final sample.\nA power analysis a posteriori was conducted for nested multiple regression models in order to verify if the sample size was adequate.\nDaylight Saving Time (DST) began in Brazil at midnight on October 15th, 2017. Residents from the Midwest, Southeast, and South regions were instructed to set the clock forward by 1 hour. We believe that this event did not contaminate the data since it started on the same day of the data collection. It’s important to notice that MCTQ asks subjects to relate their routine behavior, not how they behaved in the last few days. A possible effect of the DST on the sample would be the production of an even later chronotype for populations near the planet’s poles, amplifying a possible latitude effect. However, this was not shown on the hypothesis test.\nBased on the 2022 census (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, n.d.-a), Brazil had \\(52.263\\%\\) of females and \\(47.737\\%\\) of males with an age equal to or greater than 18 years old. The sample is skewed for female subjects, with \\(66.297\\%\\) of females and \\(33.703\\%\\) of male subjects.\nThe subjects’ mean age is \\(32.015\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 9.252\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 58.786\\)). Female subjects have a mean age of \\(31.787\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 9.364\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 58.786\\)) and male subjects \\(32.464\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 9.012\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 58.772\\)). For comparison, based on the 2022 census (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, n.d.-b), Brazil’s population with an age equal to or greater than \\(18\\) years old had a mean age of \\(44.277\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 17.221\\)), with a mean age of \\(44.987\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 17.511\\)) for female subjects and a mean age of \\(43.499\\) years (\\(\\text{SD} = 16.864\\)) for male subjects.\nConsidering the five regions of Brazil, the sample is mostly skewed for the Southeast, the most populated region. According to Brazil’s 2022 census (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2022), the Southeast region is home to \\(41.784\\%\\) of Brazil’s population, followed by the Northeast (\\(26.910\\%\\)), South (\\(14.741\\%\\)), North (\\(8.544\\%\\)), and Midwest (\\(8.021\\%\\)) regions. \\(62.454\\%\\) of the sample is located in the Southeast region, \\(11.797\\%\\) in the Northeast, \\(17.861\\%\\) in the South, \\(1.682\\%\\) in the North, and \\(6.205\\%\\) in the Midwest region. Note that a lack of subjects in the North and Midwest region is justified by the sample timezone inclusion criteria (UTC-3).\nThe sample latitudinal range was \\(30.211\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -30.109\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 0.10177\\)) with a longitudinal span of \\(16.378\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -51.342\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = -34.964\\)). For comparison, Brazil has a latitudinal range of \\(39.024\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -33.752\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = 5.2719\\)) and a longitudinal span of \\(39.198\\) decimal degrees (\\(\\text{Min.} = -34.793\\); \\(\\text{Max.} = -73.991\\)).\n\nA.3.3 Data wrangling\nThe data wrangling and analysis followed the data science program proposed by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (Wickham, 2016). All processes were made with the help of the R programming language (R Core Team, n.d.), RStudio IDE (Posit Team, n.d.), and several R packages. The tidyverse and rOpenSci package ecosystem and other R packages adherents of the tidy tools manifesto (Wickham & Bryan, 2023) were prioritized. The MCTQ data was analyzed using the mctq rOpenSci peer-reviewed package (Vartanian, 2023). All processes were made in order to provide result reproducibility and to be in accordance with the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016).\n\nA.3.4 Hypothesis test\nThe study hypothesis was tested using nested models general linear models of multiple linear regressions. The main idea of nested models is to verify the effect of the inclusion of one or more predictors in the model variance explanation (i.e., the \\(\\text{R}^{2}\\)) (Allen, 1997; Maxwell et al., 2018). This can be made by creating a restricted model and then comparing it with a full model. Hence, the hypothesis can be schematized as follows.\n\nNull hypothesis (\\(\\text{H}_{0}\\)): Adding latitude does not meaningfully improve the model’s fit, indicating that the change in adjusted \\(\\text{R}^{2}\\) is negligible or the F-test is not significant.\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(\\text{H}_{a}\\)): Adding latitude significantly improves the model’s fit, indicating that the change in adjusted \\(\\text{R}^{2}\\) is greater than the Minimum Effect Size (MES), and the F-test is significant.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{H}_{0}: \\Delta \\ \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2} \\leq \\text{MES} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{F-test is not significant} \\\\\n\\text{H}_{a}: \\Delta \\ \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2} &gt; \\text{MES} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{F-test is significant}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\\[\n\\Delta \\ \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2} = \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2}_{f} - \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2}_{r}\n\\]\nThe general equation for the F-test for nested models (Allen, 1997, p. 113) is:\n\\[\n\\text{F} = \\cfrac{\\text{R}^{2}_{f} - \\text{R}^{2}_{r} / (k_{f} - k_{R})}{(1 - \\text{R}^{2}_{f}) / (\\text{N} - k_{f} - 1)}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\n\\(\\text{R}^{2}_{F}\\) = Coefficient of determination for the full model;\n\n\\(\\text{R}^{2}_{R}\\) = Coefficient of determination for the restricted model;\n\n\\(k_{F}\\) = Number of independent variables in the full model;\n\n\\(k_{R}\\) = Number of independent variables in the restricted model;\n\n\\(\\text{N}\\) = Number of observations in the sample.\n\n\\[\n\\text{F} = \\cfrac{\\text{Additional Var. Explained} / \\text{Additional d.f. Expended}}{\\text{Var. unexplained} / \\text{d.f. Remaining}}\n\\]\nA MES must always be used in any data testing. The effect-size was present in the original Neyman and Pearson framework (Neyman & Pearson, 1928a, 1928b), but unfortunately this practice fade away with the use of p-values, one of the many issues that came with the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) (Perezgonzalez, 2015). Because the estimated p-value tends to decrease when the sample size is increased, focusing just on p-values with large sample sizes results in the rejection of the null hypothesis, making it not meaningful in this specific situation (Gómez-de-Mariscal et al., 2021).\nIt’s important to note that, in addition to the F-test, it’s assumed that for \\(\\text{R}^{2}_{\\text{r}}\\) to differ significantly from \\(\\text{R}^{2}_{\\text{f}}\\), there must be a non-negligible effect size between them. This effect size can be calculated using Cohen’s \\(f^{2}\\) (Cohen, 1988, 1992):\n\\[\n\\text{Cohen's } f^2 = \\cfrac{\\text{R}^{2}}{1 - \\text{R}^{2}}\n\\]\nFor nested models, this can be adapted as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cohen's } f^2 = \\cfrac{\\text{R}^{2}_{f} - \\text{R}^{2}_{r}}{1 - \\text{R}^{2}_{f}} = \\cfrac{\\Delta \\text{R}^{2}}{1 - \\text{R}^{2}_{f}}\n\\]\n\\[\nf^{2} = \\cfrac{\\text{Additional Var. Explained}}{\\text{Var. unexplained}}\n\\]\nConsidering the particular emphasis that the solar zeitgeber has on the entrainment of biological rhythms (as demonstrated in many experiments), it would not be reasonable to assume that the latitude hypothesis could be supported without at least a non-negligible effect size. With this in mind, this analysis will use Cohen’s threshold for small/negligible effects, the Minimum Effect Size (MES) (\\(\\delta\\)) is defined as 0.02 (Cohen, 1988, p. 413; 1992, p. 157).\nIn Cohen’s words:\n\nWhat is really intended by the invalid affirmation of a null hypothesis is not that the population ES [Effect Size] is literally zero, but rather that it is negligible, or trivial (Cohen, 1988, p. 16).\n\n\nSMALL EFFECT SIZE: \\(f^2 = .02\\). Translated into ^{2} (9.2.5) or partial ^{2} for Case 1 (9.1.8), this gives \\(.02 / (l + .02) = .0196\\). We thus define a small effect as one that accounts for 2% of the \\(\\text{Y}\\) variance (in contrast with 1% for \\(r\\)), and translate to an \\(\\text{R} = \\sqrt{0196} = .14\\) (compared to .10 for \\(r\\)). This is a modest enough amount, just barely escaping triviality and (alas!) all too frequently in practice represents the true order of magnitude of the effect being tested (Cohen, 1988, p. 413).\n\n\nBut in many circumstances, all that is intended by “proving” the null hypothesis is that the ES is not necessarily zero but small enough to be negligible, i.e., no larger than \\(i\\) (Section 1.5.5). How large \\(i\\) is will vary with the substantive context. Assume, for example, that ES is expressed as \\(f^2\\), and that the context is such as to consider \\(f^2\\) no larger than \\(.02\\) to be negligible; thus \\(i\\) = .02 (Cohen, 1988, p. 461).\n\n\\[\n\\text{MES} = \\text{Cohen's } f^2 \\text{small threshold} = 0.02 \\\\\n\\]\nFor comparison, Cohen’s threshold for medium effects is \\(0.15\\), and for large effects is \\(0.35\\) (Cohen, 1988, pp. 413–414; 1992, p. 157).\nKnowing Cohen’s \\(f^2\\), is possible to calculated the equivalent \\(\\text{R}^{2}\\):\n\\[\n0.02 = \\cfrac{\\text{R}^{2}}{1 - \\text{R}^{2}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{R}^{2} = \\cfrac{0.02}{1.02} \\eqsim 0.01960784\n\\]\nIn other words, the latitude must explain at least \\(1.960784\\%\\) of the variance in the dependent variable to be considered non-negligible. This is the Minimum Effect Size (MES) for this analysis.\nIn summary, the decision rule for the hypothesis test is as follows:\n\n\nReject \\(\\text{H}_{0}\\) if both:\n\nThe F-test is significant.\n\n\\(\\Delta \\ \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2} &gt; 0.01960784\\);\n\n\n\nFail to reject \\(\\text{H}_{0}\\) if either:\n\nThe F-test is not significant, or\nThe F-test is significant, but \\(\\Delta \\ \\text{Adjusted} \\ \\text{R}^{2} \\leq 0.01960784\\).\n\n\n\nAs usual, the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) was set at \\(0.05\\), allowing a 5% chance of a Type I error. A power analysis will be performed to determine the necessary sample size for detecting a significant effect, targeting a power (\\(1 - \\beta\\)) of \\(0.8\\).\nAssumption checks include:\n\nAssessing the normality of residuals through visual inspections, such as Q-Q plots, and statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test.\nMulticollinearity was assed by calculating variance inflation factors (VIF), with a VIF above 10 indicating potential issues. Influential points will be examined using Cook’s distance and leverage values to identify any points that may disproportionately affect model outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that relying on objective assumption tests is not advisable in this context. In larger samples, these tests can be overly sensitive to minor deviations, and in smaller samples, they may fail to detect significant ones. Furthermore, they can miss visual patterns that a single metric cannot capture (Kozak & Piepho, 2018; Schucany & Ng, 2006; Shatz, 2024). Therefore, visual inspection of diagnostic plots was deemed a more effective method for assessing the model assumptions in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s also important to emphasize that this thesis is not trying to establishing causality, only association. Predictive models alone should never be used to infer causal relationships (Arif & MacNeil, 2022).\n\n\n\n\nA.3.5 Predictors\nIn order to replicate Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017) article, it was used the covariates age, longitude, and solar irradiation when the subjects filled the online questionnaire, with sex, daylight saving time (DST), and season as a cofactors. The thesis sample have data for all these variables with exception of DST and season since the data was collected in a single week, hence, the DST and season variables were not included in the model.\nAs a latitude proxy, the same authors used the annual average solar irradiation, sunrise time, sunset time and daylight duration in March equinox, June, and December solstices for each volunteer. All these variables can be integrated with the sample. This analysis will also perform another test using only the latitude variable as a new predictor in the full model.\nThe solar radiation data is based on Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) 2017 Laboratory of Modeling and Studies of Renewable Energy Resources (LABREN) 2017 Solar Energy Atlas (Pereira et al., 2017) (the data was collected in 2017). There are many types of solar radiation, unfortunately, Leocadio-Miguel et al. (2017), but is reasonable to think they used the global horizontal solar irradiation (GHI) as a proxy for solar radiation. The GHI is the total amount of shortwave radiation received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground. That’s what will be used. You can find more information in about these metrics in Pereira et al. (2017).\nTherefore, the same hypothesis will be tested three times with different predictors, as follows.\n\nA.3.5.1 Test 1\n\nPredictors for the restricted model: age, sex, longitude, and GHI when the subjects filled the online questionnaire.\nPredictors for the full model: (predictors for the restricted model) + annual average GHI, daylight duration in March equinox, June, and December solstices, and sunrise time and sunset when the subjects filled the online questionnaire.\n\nA.3.5.2 Test 2\n\nPredictors for the restricted model: age, sex, longitude, and GHI when the subjects filled the online questionnaire.\nPredictors for the full model: (predictors for the restricted model) + annual average GHI, daylight duration in March equinox, June, and December solstices, and sunrise time and sunset when the subjects filled the online questionnaire + latitude.\n\nA.3.5.3 Test 3\n\nPredictors for the restricted model: age, sex, longitude, and GHI when the subjects filled the online questionnaire.\nPredictors for the full model: (predictors for the restricted model) + latitude\n\nIt’s important to note that the inclusion of some these variables may produce issues regarding multicollinearity. If this occur, the variables will be removed from the model.\nA power analysis will be performed to determine the necessary sample size for each test. Considering the original sample size this probably will not be an issue.",

    "text": "A.4 An overview of general linear models\nBefore proceeding, here’s briefly overview general linear models, with a focus on multiple regression analysis. This will be used as a reference for model diagnostics.\n\n[…] A problem of this type is called a problem of multiple linear regression because we are considering the regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(k\\) variables \\(X_{1}, \\dots, X_{k}\\), rather than on just a single variable \\(X\\), and we are assuming also that this regression is a linear function of the parameters \\(\\beta_{0}, \\dots, \\beta_{k}\\). In a problem of multiple linear regressions, we obtain \\(n\\) vectors of observations (\\(x_{i1}. \\dots, x_{ik}, Y_{i}\\)), for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\). Here \\(x_{ij}\\) is the observed value of the variable \\(X_{j}\\) for the \\(i\\)th observation. The \\(E(Y)\\) is given by the relation\n\n\\[\nE(Y_{i}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i1} + \\dots + \\beta_{k} x_{ik}\n\\]\n(DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 738)\n\nA.4.1 Definitions\n\nResiduals/Fitted values\n\nFor \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), the observed values of \\(\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_{0} + \\hat{\\beta}_{1} x_{i}\\) are called fitted values. For \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), the observed values of \\(e_{i} = y_{i} - \\hat{y}_{i}\\) are called residuals (DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 717).\n\n\n\n[…] regression problems in which the observations \\(Y_{i}, \\dots, Y_{n}\\) […] we shall assume that each observation \\(Y_{i}\\) has a normal distribution, that the observations \\(Y_{1}, \\dots, Y_{n}\\) are independent, and that the observations \\(Y_{1}, \\dots, Y_{n}\\) have the same variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\). Instead of a single predictor being associated with each \\(Y_{i}\\), we assume that a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector \\(z_{i} = (z_{i0}, \\dots, z_{ip - 1})\\) is associated with each \\(Y_{i}\\)” (DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 736).\n\n\nGeneral linear model\n\nThe statistical model in which the observations \\(Y_{1}, \\dots, Y_{n}\\) satisfy the following assumptions (DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 738).\n\n\nA.4.2 Assumptions\n\nAssumption 1\n\nPredictor is known. Either the vectors \\(z_{1}, \\dots , z_{n}\\) are known ahead of time, or they are the observed values of random vectors \\(Z_{1}, \\dots , Z_{n}\\) on whose values we condition before computing the joint distribution of (\\(Y_{1}, \\dots , Y_{n}\\)) (DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 736).\n\nAssumption 2\n\nNormality. For \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), the conditional distribution of \\(Y_{i}\\) given the vectors \\(z_{1}, \\dots , z_{n}\\) is a normal distribution (DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 737).\n\n\n(Normality of the error term distribution (Hair, 2019, p. 287))\n\nAssumption 3\n\nLinear mean. There is a vector of parameters \\(\\beta = (\\beta_{0}, \\dots, \\beta_{p - 1})\\) such that the conditional mean of \\(Y_{i}\\) given the values \\(z_{1}, \\dots , z_{n}\\) has the form\n\n\n\\[\nz_{i0} \\beta_{0} + z_{i1} \\beta_{1} + \\cdots + z_{ip - 1} \\beta_{p - 1}\n\\]\nfor \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\) (DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 737).\n(Linearity of the phenomenon measured (Hair, 2019, p. 287))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to clarify that the linear assumption pertains to linearity in the parameters or equivalently, linearity in the coefficients. This means that each predictor is multiplied by its corresponding regression coefficient. However, this does not imply that the relationship between the predictors and the response variable is linear. In fact, a linear model can still effectively capture non-linear relationships between predictors and the response variable by utilizing transformations of the predictors (Cohen et al., 2002).\n\n\n\n\nAssumption 4\n\nCommon variance (homoscedasticity). There is as parameter \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) such the conditional variance of \\(Y_{i}\\) given the values \\(z_{1}, \\dots , z_{n}\\) is \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\).\n\n\n(Constant variance of the error terms (Hair, 2019, p. 287))\n\nAssumption 5\n\nIndependence. The random variables \\(Y_{1}, \\dots , Y_{n}\\) are independent given the observed \\(z_{1}, \\dots , z_{n}\\) (DeGroot & Schervish, 2012, p. 737).\n\n\n(Independence of the error terms (Hair, 2019, p. 287))",
